    but we could also use the _azureus_ integrated tracker.

Bittorent can be identified by `.torrent` files, {{< wp " Magnet link" >}}, or
by a sha1 hash sum. The Magnet link can contain many hashes used by
diverse protocols. Bittorents client use the _btih_ which is the SHA-1
hash sums of the "info" sections of BitTorrent metafiles i.e
`.torrent` files. In the magnet link the _btih_ is written
``xt=urn:btih:[ Info Hash (Hex) ]``. For more info on Magnet link
look at the {{< wp " Magnet link"  "Wikipedia Page" >}}.

[Torrent to Magnet](http://torrent2magnet.com/) is a web service to
convert between `.torrent` files and magnet links.

The npm library and command line [parse-torrent
](https://github.com/feross/parse-torrent) also gives all the
informations in a `.torrent` file.

## WebTorrent {#webtorrent}
[WebTorrent](https://webtorrent.io/) protocol works just like
BitTorrent protocol, except it uses
{{< iref "#webrtc" "WebRTC" >}} instead of TCP/uTP as
the transport protocol, it implies changes to the tracker
protocol. Therefore, a browser-based WebTorrent client can only
connect to other clients that support WebTorrent/WebRTC.

[WebTorrent](https://webtorrent.io/) reference applications
are streaming torrent clients for Node.js and the web. WebTorrent
provides the same API in both environments.

The module in node.js is a simple torrent client, using TCP and
UDP to talk to other torrent clients; but which allow to communicate
also with WebTorrent WebRTC trackers. You can use it
[on your page by including the javascript library
](https://webtorrent.io/intro).

The Desktop reference client is
[WebTorrent Desktop](https://webtorrent.io/desktop/), they are
download for Linux (.deb package), Mac, Windoze.

In the browser, WebTorrent uses {{< iref "#webrtc" "WebRTC" >}}
(data channels) for peer-to-peer transport. _WebTorrent does not
support UDP/TCP peers in browser_.

To seed files to web peers, use a client that supports WebTorrent,
e.g. [WebTorrent Desktop](https://webtorrent.io/desktop),
[webtorrent-hybrid](https://github.com/feross/webtorrent-hybrid)
a command line program, or [Instant.io](https://instant.io/)
a website. Vuze has a [WebTorrent plugin
](https://wiki.vuze.com/w/WebTorrent) so it can connect to both
normal and web peers.

Before choosing a P2P file sharing protocol we must be aware of the
lack of privacy of P2P and the risk for anybody to  be framed for
copyright infringement, even without downloading any copyrighted or
DRM material. It is explained in an article from Washington university
cse [Tracking the Trackers](http://dmca.cs.washington.edu/index.html),
and the associated [FAQ](http://dmca.cs.washington.edu/faq.html).

Wikipedia {{< wp "Privacy in file sharing networks" >}} explain that most or
all P2P network can be tracked even eMule or Gnutella. So we have to
rely on {{< wp "Anonymous P2P" >}}, mainly through {{< wp "I2P" >}}; or on
{{< wp "Friend-to-friend"  "F2F (Friend to Friend" >}}.

## P2P file transfer {#p2p_file_transfer}
Is an alternative to store a file for exchange, as the file are not saved in the cloud
they are available for big files, and once the transfer done the file can not be stolen.

Some applications use dedicated applications, some have a web
interface with transfer in {{< wp "WebRTC" >}}, mainly those built on
{{< iref "#webtorrent" "WebTorrent" >}} and work with
{{< wp "WebRTC#Support"  "compatible browsers" >}}, some have both.

For uploading on android with the web interface see
{{< iref "clouds#android_web_upload" "this note" >}}.

Take care than most {{< iref "#webtorrent" "WebTorrent" >}}
based application don't offer encryption or any privacy, your file can
be viewed by any body having or guessing the URL or magnet Link.

-   [justbeamit](https://www.justbeamit.com/) is a P2P file transfer
    service. It has no encryption or password protection.
    transfer from and to android work.
-   [reep.io](https://reep.io/) _no longer available ?_
    is a P2P file transfer service, which
    works with browsers supporting webrtc, namely chrome, firefox, or
    opera.  The file is encrypted and sent directly.
    Both browsers must remain open during the full transfer. A
    password protection is available.
    transfer from android with dolphin or chrome work but UC is rejected.
-   [ShareDrop](https://www.sharedrop.io/) is a P2P WebRtc file transfer web
    application.
    It allows to share directly on the lan or via an URL on wan.
-   <a name="sendanywhere"></a> [Send Anywhere](https://send-anywhere.com/) (
    Private License)
    is mainly a P2P service, but also include cloud storage to free the sender from the
    contraint that both browser need to be open during all the transfer time.

    You can transfer up to 1G for the web service, up to 20G using a dedicated desktop
    app (windows, ios, android, linux, chrome extension).Registering is not deemed, and
    the applications are free.

    File transfer using the 6-digit key transfers files directly between the two devices
    in P2P, and does not store files on the server.

    For link sharing and send to device, files are encrypted and uploaded to the server
    temporarily.

    The Send Anywhere link is valid 48h.  For gmail you can send up to 10GB stored in
    the cloud for 7 days.

    Note that the web interface is unavailable with an android user-agent, we are
    supposed to download the android apk. When setting the user-agent to desktop we can
    use the classic web interface.

-   They are many other WebTorrent clients in the browser, but for most of them your
    file are public and without protection.

    To use it in wan, you have also to use a port which is not blocked by the firewall.
    You can also use it in lan on a port non available on wan, to mitigate the risk of
    your data being spied.
