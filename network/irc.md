-   {{< iref "xmpp#bitlbee" "bitlbee" >}} is an IRC to
    other chat networks gateway, such as AIM, ICQ, Microsoft Messenger, Yahoo!,
    Jabber and Google Talk, and Facebook Messenger,
    Twitter, Identi.ca, and status.net.
    Iit allows you to browse other chat
    protocols with your irc client. bitlbee can be usefull if you want
    to use only a light irc client to take part in chats from many
    protocols including jabber/ssl as in gmail accounts.</br>

    It is uneasy to compare the size of these client to other clients,
    if you have to launch emacs only to chat, it cost you 18M, it is
    my mean emacs size, that is 13M bare size + 5M packages. But if
    you have always an emacs running from the beginning of your
    session to the end, as I use to do on my main desktop, it costs
    you virtually nothing (circe is tiny and loading it is not
    perceptible when looking at res. mem. size).
