    authbind allows the system administrator to permit specific users
    and groups access to bind to privileged TCP and UDP ports below
    1024. _authbind_ is in Debian.

    It has similar aim to
    {{< iref "#privbind" "privbind" >}} but this last one is a
    user space solution that need to be launched by root. Both
    override the bind() calls by a replacement library
    selected thanks to a `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable.


    We can also use the capability `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` to allow a
    user program to bind to privileged ports.
    [Bind ports below 1024 without root on GNU/Linux
    ](http://www.wensley.org.uk/capabilities)
    for more informations.

    But _privbind_ Readme tell that that inheritance of capabilities
    has never been implemented so this solution is limited.

# TCP /UDP tools {#tcp_udp_tools}
## Netcat {#netcat}
{{< wp " netcat" >}} is a C utility for reading from and writing to network
connections using TCP or UDP; The features from the original _nc110_
are:

-   Outbound or inbound (`-l`) connections, TCP or UDP (`-u`), to or
    from any ports.
-   Ability to broadcast UDP. (`-b`)
-   Full DNS forward/reverse checking, with appropriate warnings.
-   Ability to use any local source port.
-   Ability to use any locally-configured network source address.
-   Built-in port-scanning capabilities, with randomizer.
-   Built-in loose source-routing capability.
-   Can read command line arguments from standard input.
-   Slow-send mode, one line every N seconds. (`-i`)
-   Hex dump of transmitted and received data. (`-o`)
-   Optional ability to let another program service established
    connections.
-   Optional telnet-options responder. (`-t`)

These features are shared by all versions of netcat. Some details
differ.

### Different flavours of netcat

-   The _openbsd netcat_ allow to use ipv6 not the gnu or _nc110_;
-   The _openbsd netcat_ in listen mode `-l` can keep listening after
    its current connection is closed with `-k`, this option does not
    exist on _gnu netcat_ or _nc110_.
-   The _openbsd netcat_ can use UNIX-domain sockets with `-U`.
-   The _openbsd netcat_ can use a proxy (options `-P`, `-X`, `-x`)
-   The _openbsd netcat_ can use
    {{< wp "Datagram Congestion Control Protocol" >}} `-Z`.
-   _nc110_ and _gnu netcat_ provide `-c` and `-e` options to execute a
    command, this option does not exist in openbsd version. But
    you can still do this by a redirection as explained in
    [nc.openbsd manual](https://manned.org/nc.openbsd).
-   The _gnu netcat_ has a tunnel capability that you don't find
    elsewhere.
-   The _gnu netcat_ has some differences between options such as those
    mentionned in the [migration paper
    ](https://sourceforge.net/p/netcat/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/doc/migration).
    As it seems it is now less used than the two other versions, I
    don't explicit the details.

-   [nc110](http://nc110.sourceforge.net/) is the original netcat,
    free open source, but with an unclear license.<br/>
    The Debian package is _netcat-traditional_ and the canonical
    binary name is _nc_ on Debian it is _nc.traditional_ and can be
    linked to _nc_ and _netcat_ as an _alternative_.
    -   [netcat.traditional - nc(1)
        ](https://manpages.debian.org/unstable/netcat-traditional/nc.1.en.html)
-   [ gnu netcat ](http://netcat.sourceforge.net/) (GPL) is a rewrite of
    _nc110_. One goal of _gnu netcat_ was to have a full compatibility with
    netcat110 (which stopped developping in 1996) but the last
    release of gnu-netcat which date from 2004 is not completely
    compatible with _nc110_ (some details of differences in the
    [migration paper
    ](https://sourceforge.net/p/netcat/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/doc/migration)
    This program is not packaged by Debian.
-   [openbsd nc
    ](https://github.com/openbsd/src/tree/master/usr.bin/nc)
    (BSD License) is an improvement of _nc110_
    -   [nc.openbsd - nc(1)](https://manned.org/nc.openbsd) or in
        Debian manpages [nc.openbsd - nc(1)
        ](https://manpages.debian.org/unstable/netcat-openbsd/nc.1.en.html).

### Netcat documentation

-   The [manual of openbsd netcat
    ](https://manpages.debian.org/unstable/netcat-openbsd/nc.1.en.html)
    contains a detailled description an some simple examples.
-   The [wikipedia Netcat page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat)
    contains many examples. _(but a note indicate the examples have to
    be moved elsewhere)_
-   For _nc110_ the manual [netcat.traditional - nc(1)
    ](https://manpages.debian.org/unstable/netcat-traditional/nc.1.en.html)
    is very succint, but it is because the core of the doc is in the big
    [nc110 README](http://nc110.sourceforge.net/) that is also
    installed with the _netcat.traditional_ package, this documentation
    contains a detailled description of all options and example with
    comprehensive comments. It is completed by the
    [script directory
    ](https://sourceforge.net/p/nc110/git/ci/master/tree/scripts/)
    that you find with  _netcat.traditional_ but not with the openbsd
    or the gnu version.
-   [Netcat for the Masses (pdf)
    ](http://www.infosecwriters.com/text_resources/pdf/Netcat_for_the_Masses_DDebeer.pdf)
    from Dean De Beer introduce in details many different uses
    of netcat.
-   The [nc introduction
    ](http://www.stearns.org/doc/nc-intro.current.html)
    by William Stearns focus on the usage as tcp server, and proxy.

    ](https://www.hackingtutorials.org/networking/hacking-with-netcat-part-3-advanced-techniques/).

## Other TCP/UDP tools
-   [ncat](https://nmap.org/ncat/) is an improved netcat from the nmap
    project. It support all _netcat_ features but add many features.

    Among the added features: chain Ncats together; redirection of
    TCP, UDP, and SCTP ports to other sites; SSL support; proxy
    connections (with optional proxy authentication) via SOCKS4 or
    HTTP proxies; ipv6 support; SCTP support; allows multiple hosts to
    connect to a centralized Ncat server and communicate with each
    other.

    Ncat is in the _nmap_ distribution, so if you have _nmap_ you
    should have _Ncat_ too.
