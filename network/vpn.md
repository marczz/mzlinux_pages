# WireGuard
[WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) (GPLv2 for the Kernel)
is an encrypted VPN. It is designed to be easy to use and features high speed
performance, and low attack surface and better performance and more power than IPsec and
OpenVP.

        ](https://www.procustodibus.com/blog/2020/10/wireguard-topologies/#point-to-site)
        describes the different topologies we can use. They are Point to Point, Hub and
        Spoke, Point to Site, Site to Site. The corresponding wireguard settings is
        covered in the following articles.
    -   [WireGuard Point to Point Configuration

    -   [WireGuard Hub and Spoke Configuration
        ](https://www.procustodibus.com/blog/2020/11/wireguard-hub-and-spoke-config/).
        The configuration youâ€™d use when you want to connect two endpoints running
        WireGuard, but both endpoints are behind restrictive NAT or firewalls that do
        not allow either endpoint to accept new connections from the other. This
        requires using a third WireGuard host that can accept new connections from the
        two endpoints.
