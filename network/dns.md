## Zeroconf

[Zeroconf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeroconf) allows automatic address selection
([rfc 3927](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3927),
[rfc 2462](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2462)
for ipV6), name resolution by multicast DNS *mDNS*
([rfc 4795](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4795)
Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR)) , and DNS based
Service Discovery (DNS-SD)(
[rfc2782](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2782))
also implemented in the Service Location Protocol (SLP) (
[rfc 2608](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2608)
and
[rfc 3224](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3224)).

-   The Zeroconf model is implemented in the
    [Apple Bonjour *(Wikipedia)*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonjour_%28software%29)
    *(apache license 2.0)* which is also available in linux and
    windoze; and

-   Avahi ([Avahi Home page](http://avahi.org/)

-   [Arch Wiki: Avahi](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Avahi)
-   [Debian Wiki: Zeroconf](https://wiki.debian.org/ZeroConf)
    gives the current support of avahi by software.

# DNS Tools

    You can learn about whois in the {{< wp "Whois"  "whois Wikipedia page" >}} or in the
    [whois overview](http://navigators.com/whois.html "navigators.com whois.html")
    and query it thru the commandline

    [geektools whois gateway](http://www.geektools.com/whois.php)
-   [DNSd](https://github.com/behrooza/dnsd) is a daemon that provides a local DNS
    backend to forward the queries/answers to/from {{< wp "Google Public DNS" >}} over
    HTTPS.


# Useful Registrars

    ](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Resolv.conf#Alternative_DNS_servers).
-    Google provide free dns at `8.8.8.8` and `8.8.4.4`.
-   [internic](http://www.internic.net/) has a list of registrars
-   registrar: <https://www.gandi.net/>

    are used to link the DHCP IP adress with the static hostname.
-   [dyndns](http://www.dyndns.com/) was previously
    free.  Now dyn is 25$/year. See also

    -   [How to use ddclient with Namecheap
        ](http://www.ducky-pond.com/posts/2014/Feb/how-to-use-ddclient-with-namecheap/).
-   {{< iref "web_servers" "Polipo" >}} does not use
    `gethostbyname` but use its own resolve code, and it does not look at
    `/etc/hosts`, so we have to disable polypo for the domains where we
    want to use `/etc/hosts` or use the dns cache itself.

# Systemd-resolved
systemd-resolved is a system service that provides network name resolution to local
applications via a D-Bus interface. It implements a caching and validating DNS/DNSSEC
stub resolver, as well as an LLMNR and MulticastDNS resolver and responder.

# Unbound
[unbound](https://unbound.net/) (BSD license) is a validating,
recursive, and caching DNS resolver. Along {{< wp "Unbound (DNS server)"  "Wikipedia" >}}
> Unbound has supplanted the Berkeley Internet
> Name Daemon (BIND) as the default, base-system name server in several
> open source projects, where it is perceived as smaller, more modern,
>  and more secure for most applications.

Unbound is packaged in Debian.

# Dnsmasq {#dnsmask}

DNSMASQ (GPL) is a a lightweight tftp, DHCP and caching DNS server.

As DNS cache dnsmasq accepts DNS queries and either answers them from a
small, local, cache or forwards them to a real, recursive, DNS server.

Dnsmasq is also a dhcpd server. It supports static address assignments,
multiple networks, Bootp and vendor-encapsulated options, DHCP-relay and
RFC3011 subnet specifiers.

-   [systemd-resolved - ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd-resolved).
-   `/etc/resolv.conf` is overwritten
    [by NetworkManager][https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NetworkManager#/etc/resolv.conf)
    and [by dhcpd](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dhcpcd#/etc/resolv.conf).
