## Readability Software {#readability_software}

Most browsers offer a _reader view_ that offer an uncluttered view of
the page like the builtin [Firefox Reader View
](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-reader-view-clutter-free-web-pages)
that you activate in clicking on the small book on the right end of
the URL form. When in Reader mode you can tweak the font, background
color, line width and column size with the __Aa__ button on the left
bar.

On Chrome there are many extensions to remove adds and distractions
from the web page, like
[Mercury Reader
](https://mercury.postlight.com/reader/)
 [Just Read
](https://github.com/ZachSaucier/Just-Read),
_EasyReader_, _Read Mode_, _Reader View_, _Chrome
Reader View_ (same then _Firefox Reader View_), _Purify_, _Outline_
and more ...

In Safari there is now a [builtin Reader Mode
](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/06/08/safari_reader_based_on_open_source_project/)
based on {{< iref "#readability" "Readability plugin" >}},
this buton is available as well on Mac OSX and on IOS.

There are also many open source libraries for cleaning feeds, or web
pages.

_Arc90 Labs_ produced the _Readability_ bookmarklet to remove the clutter around what
you're reading. They replaced it later with a whole web service at
http://www.readability.com, and five years latter abandoned it. They propose to switch
to _Mercury_ and the
[Mercury Reader Chrome plugin](https://mercury.postlight.com/reader/).
