## Tramp {#tramp}
-   [Tramp (manual)](https://www.gnu.org/software/tramp/)
-   [EmacsWiki: Tramp](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TrampMode)
-   [wikemacs: Tramp](http://wikemacs.org/index.php/TRAMP)
    describe the use of [multi-hop access
    ](http://wikemacs.org/index.php/TRAMP#Multiple_hops).
-   We can use bookmarks with Tramp, when you visit a remote file or
    directory you just bookmark it with `C-x r m` then you can jump
    back to it with `C-x r b`.  Bookmark+ or Dired+ makes it even
    easier as explained in [this post
    ](http://stackoverflow.com/a/20649631/965798).

### Multi hops with Tramp  {#tramp_multihops}
On emacs > 24 you can use multihops with on a stable basis by
configuring the variable `tramp-default-proxies-alist` as [described
in the manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/tramp/#Multi_002dhops).

This user option is list of triples consisting of (_host_ _user_ _proxy_)
_host_ and _user_ are regular expressions that should match the one
given in the tramp uri, nil is used as always matching.

_proxy_ is a literal TRAMP file name `/<method>:<user>@<host>:` where
_method_ and _user_ name are optionals. If _proxy_ is nil no extra hop
is used.

The manual gives the example:

    (add-to-list 'tramp-default-proxies-alist
        '("\\." nil "/ssh:bird@bastion.your.domain:"))
    (add-to-list 'tramp-default-proxies-alist
        '("\\.your\\.domain\\'" nil nil))

So every access to  an host of `your.domain` is direct as it comes
first in the list; all other hosts are going through
`bastion.your.domain` as user `bird`.

Proxy can be cascaded in the alist, and take patterns %h or %u for
host or user. _Look at the [manual
](https://www.gnu.org/software/tramp/#Multi_002dhops)
or info node `C-hig (tramp)multi-hops`
for details._

To ssh to an host, then become root with sudo you can add

    (add-to-list 'tramp-default-proxies-alist
        '("\\`server\\.your\\.domain\\'" "\\`root\\'" "/ssh:server.your.domain:"))

So any access to _server.your.domain_ as root like
`/sudo:server.your.domain` will go through a ssh connection under your
account name. Note that the syntax `/sudo:server.your.domain` without
this ssh hop is not valid, as sudo can only be used on a localhost.

We can also without any configuration use an had-hock access by
specifying it in the tramp uri. The previous example would be:

    /ssh:server.your.domain|/sudo:server.your.domain:/path/of/file

take care that the host name resolution is done on
the local site. So `sudo::` or `sudo:localhost:` will bring you
back to _your_ localhost.

This feature is also described in the [html manual
](https://www.gnu.org/software/tramp/#Ad_002dhoc-multi_002dhops)
or info  node `C-hig (tramp)Ad-hoc multi-hops`

When doing an su or sudo, either on local host or remote host it can
be carreful to disable backups, or force them to be done as root as
explained in [manual - Auto save and Backup
](https://www.gnu.org/software/tramp/#Auto_002dsave-and-Backup).

EmacsWiki has example on how to [Using Tramp to open files sudo'd to
