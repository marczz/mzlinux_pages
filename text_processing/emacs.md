-   [EmacsWiki: Making Packages](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MakingPackages)
-   [ELPA](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ELPA) is the main packaging system for Emacs
    as it is included in emacs since emacs 24.
    -   [ELPA Home](http://tromey.com/elpa/),
    -   [elpa.gnu.org/](http://elpa.gnu.org/) official repository, now replaced by
        [Melpa](http://melpa.milkbox.net/).
    -   [Melpa](http://melpa.milkbox.net/) (
        [Melpa source on GitHub](https://github.com/milkypostman/melpa)) is a collaborative
        development repository.

        MELPA, has a cron to pull from upstream sources.  MELPA thus presents the
        _bleeding edge_ of packages.

-   [El-Get](https://github.com/dimitri/el-get) ([WTFPL](http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/)
    License) from Dimitri Fontaine
    allows you to install and manage elisp code for Emacs.
    It supports  different types of sources including elpa packages, git, privately hosted code ....
    El get  is able to install the packages, update them and remove them,
    it will also init them for you.

    _el-get_ is nowady less useful than previously, because
    newer package managers like {{< iref "#cask" "Cask" >}},
    {{< iref "#straight" "Straight" >}}, {{< iref "#borg" "Borg" >}},
    {{< iref "#quelpa"  "Quelpa" >}} allow the use of any git repository.
    -   [EmacsWiki: el-get](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/el-get) is a tutorial

    manage packages as git submodules. It uses the
    [Emacsmirror](http://github.com/emacsmirror) which collects Emacs Lisp packages and
    distributes them in form of Git repositories.

    is a project management tool for Emacs Lisp to automate the package development
    cycle; development, dependencies, testing, building, packaging and more.  _Cask_ is
    also used to manage emacs configuration.
    -   [Cask - Github](https://github.com/cask/cask)
-   <a name="quelpa"></a>[Quelpa](https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa) (GPL)
    is a tool to compile and install packages locally from local or remote source code.
    quelpa gets the package source code, builds an ELPA compatible package and installs
    that locally with package.el. It allows to build the bleeding edge of MELPA
    packages, and also packages from other sources, like github repositories. As example
    we install the package _cheat_ with:
    ``` elisp
    (quelpa '(cheat :fetcher github :repo "pbellon/cheat"))
    ```

references on packages, I only list in the followings subsections some
package that I use, mainly to remember what choice I have made for
domains which are targeted by many packages.

[Tempo](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TempoMode) which can be extended with
the [Tempo Snippets](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TempoSnippets) front end

Tempo is used with org-mode by the library `org-tempo.el`. Org Tempo reimplements
completions of structure template before point For example, strings like `<e` at the
beginning of the line will be expanded to an example block. The block templetes are in
the `org-structure-template-alist` and `org-keyword-template-alist` alist. You can add there other sblock types.
They are inserted by typing '<' 'key' 'TAB', you cn also choose them with a menu by
typing `C-c C,` (`org-insert-structure-template`).

[yasnippet](https://github.com/joaotavora/yasnippet)
is a template system for Emacs. It allows you to type an abbreviation and automatically
expand it into function templates.

you don't have to define a shortcut like in Yasnippet. But you can choose the snippet to
insert, optionaly with a keyword.
It allows to have different sets of text snippets for different situations while
Yasnippet defines a set of snippets for each mode.

-   [wikemacs: Tramp](http://wikemacs.org/index.php/TRAMP)
    describe the use of [multi-hop access
    ](http://wikemacs.org/index.php/TRAMP#Multiple_hops).
-   We can use bookmarks with Tramp, when you visit a remote file or
    directory you just bookmark it with `C-x r m` then you can jump
    back to it with `C-x r b`.  Bookmark+ or Dired+ makes it even
    easier as explained in [this post
    ](http://stackoverflow.com/a/20649631/965798).

### Multi hops with Tramp  {#tramp_multihops}
On emacs > 24 you can use multihops with on a stable basis by
configuring the variable `tramp-default-proxies-alist` as [described
in the manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/tramp/#Multi_002dhops).

This user option is list of triples consisting of (_host_ _user_ _proxy_)
_host_ and _user_ are regular expressions that should match the one
given in the tramp uri, nil is used as always matching.

_proxy_ is a literal TRAMP file name `/<method>:<user>@<host>:` where
_method_ and _user_ name are optionals. If _proxy_ is nil no extra hop
is used.

The manual gives the example:

    (add-to-list 'tramp-default-proxies-alist
        '("\\." nil "/ssh:bird@bastion.your.domain:"))
    (add-to-list 'tramp-default-proxies-alist
        '("\\.your\\.domain\\'" nil nil))

So every access to  an host of `your.domain` is direct as it comes
first in the list; all other hosts are going through
`bastion.your.domain` as user `bird`.

Proxy can be cascaded in the alist, and take patterns %h or %u for
host or user. _Look at the [manual
](https://www.gnu.org/software/tramp/#Multi_002dhops)
or info node `C-hig (tramp)multi-hops`
for details._

To ssh to an host, then become root with sudo you can add

    (add-to-list 'tramp-default-proxies-alist
        '("\\`server\\.your\\.domain\\'" "\\`root\\'" "/ssh:server.your.domain:"))

So any access to _server.your.domain_ as root like
`/sudo:server.your.domain` will go through a ssh connection under your
account name. Note that the syntax `/sudo:server.your.domain` without
this ssh hop is not valid, as sudo can only be used on a localhost.

We can also without any configuration use an had-hock access by
specifying it in the tramp uri. The previous example would be:

    /ssh:server.your.domain|/sudo:server.your.domain:/path/of/file

take care that the host name resolution is done on
the local site. So `sudo::` or `sudo:localhost:` will bring you
back to _your_ localhost.

This feature is also described in the [html manual
](https://www.gnu.org/software/tramp/#Ad_002dhoc-multi_002dhops)
or info  node `C-hig (tramp)Ad-hoc multi-hops`

When doing an su or sudo, either on local host or remote host it can
be carreful to disable backups, or force them to be done as root as
explained in [manual - Auto save and Backup
](https://www.gnu.org/software/tramp/#Auto_002dsave-and-Backup).

EmacsWiki has example on how to
[Using Tramp to open files sudo'd to root
](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TrampMode#toc20)
and [Using tramp to quickly edit files as root
](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TrampMode#toc29).

# Emacs color themes {#emacs_themes}
See also {{< iref "desktop#color_themes" "Desktop Color themes" >}}.

There are a lot of color themes provided with emacs, in the
`/usr/share/emacs/<version>/etc/themes` you find _as far of emacs 26_:
adwaita, deeper-blue, dichromacy, [leuven], light-blue, manoj-dark, misterioso,
tango-dark, tango, tsdh-dark, tsdh-light, wheatgrass, whiteboard.


in elpa you find more than 260
packages with themes, and in github there are around 70 packages with
[emacs-theme topic](https://github.com/topics/emacs-theme).

In emacs version ≥ 24 you use [custom themes
](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Custom-Themes.html#Custom-Themes).

To use a theme you use `customize theme` or `load-theme` you have there the possibility
to enable a theme, that was not previously enabled.
To disable a theme use `disable-theme`.

All the enabled themes are in the
list `custom-enabled-themes`. If you always want to enable only one theme you can
advertise this function as indicated in [this stack overflow answer
](https://stackoverflow.com/a/15595000):

``` elisp
(defadvice load-theme
  (before theme-dont-propagate activate)
  (mapcar #'disable-theme custom-enabled-themes))
```


All the themes should be in a directory from the list `custom-theme-load-path`, for which
you can define a custom value. Note that themes installed from MELPA use to add
themselves to `custom-theme-load-path` in their autoloads

The legacy way of setting a color theme was with the package `color-thes.el`, it was
providing many themes that are now moved in the package [replace-colorthemes
](https://github.com/emacs-jp/replace-colorthemes).


The [use of legacy color themes](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ColorThemes) is
described in EmacsWiki along additionals
[color theme questions](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ColorThemeQuestions).

To conceive, or customize a color theme you will have to change faces, so you need to
change the palette, for that packages like _rainbow-mode_ which colorize color names in
buffers, or [palette and facemenu+](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ColorPalette) are
very usefull. _palette_ provides a general color palette that you can use to examine
color properties or choose colors and and _faceMenu+_ gives point-and-click access to
faces and their colors, including access to the color palette.

On GitHub the theme first by numbers of stars is the _dark_ theme [zenburn]. It is also
the first by [popularity on MELPA](https://emacsthemes.com/popular/index.html).
[zenburn] is a low contrast color themes port of the popular
[zenburn for vim](http://kippura.org/zenburnpage/). Some [zenburn screen shots
](https://emacsthemes.com/themes/zenburn-theme.html) are available here and also in
[emacs theme gallery].

The author of [zenburn][], Bozhidar Batsov who authored and maintain also
{{< iref "#prelude" "Emacs distribution Prelude" >}}; also maintain an other theme
second by popularity, and first _light_ theme, [solarized][]. [solarized][] is a port
of  [solarized for vim].

Some screenshots are
[available here](https://emacsthemes.com/themes/solarized-themes.html).

One of the more popular set of themes, not only in emacs but on the desktop is
base16. In [base16 collection of themes for emacs][base16].
Screenshots of different variants of base16 are
[in emacsthemes](https://emacsthemes.com/pages/search.html?search=base16) and also

## Org aware color themes


Worg has a page on [org color themes](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-color-themes.html)
which contain a list of color themes that are aware of Org. There is also a page of
[screenshots of some of these themes
](https://orgmode.org/worg/color-themes-screenshot.html).


## Markdown aware themes

Many theme packages have _some_ support for Markdown mode, alas very often this support
is only partial or down for a previous version of the mode.

Among the havocs of this theme support, I noticed

-   Very often `markdown-inline-face` is not defined, so it takes it's value in
    `markdown-mode.el`, so it inherit of `markdown-code-face` and
    `font-lock-constant-face`. `markdown-code-face` derive from `fixed-pitch` that takes
    the family monospace, `font-lock.el` define a default for
    `font-lock-constant-face`: `dark cyan` on light background; and `Aquamarine` on
    dark backgrounds.

    So if nothing else is defined we end up with `dark cyan`, `monospace`, or
    `Aquamarine`, `monospace` which may be convenient on many backgrounds, light or
    dark.

    Among the themes defining `markdown-inline-face` value I have noted [parchment],
    [leuven], [tao]

-   The list are initiated by the character `*` or `-` and colored with
    `markdown-list-face`, inheriting from ` markdown-markup-face` inheriting from
    `shadow`. In `faces.el` a default foreground is specified depending of the
    background grey70, grey50, green or yellow.

    When the theme has a black or very dark background, and you use the default this
    _shadow_ face don't catch the eye.


## Asciidoc Aware Themes

[Asciidoc Mode][adoc] don't define faces, but rely on [Markup Faces][markup-faces] which
is a face package tailored for markup languages, as [font-lock][] is used for programming
language.


It seems that only few themes support [Markup Faces][markup-faces], among them you find
[zenburn][].
