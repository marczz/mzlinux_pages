# Terminal editors {#terminal_editors}
## nano
[Nano](http://www.nano-editor.org/) (GPL) <a name="nano"></a>
is a tiny editor, that provide a superset of _pico_.

Nano is truly tiny, without loading syntax files nano 2.2 takes
on an amd64 or either on an arm server 1.3M resident with 1M  shared (with no file loaded),
with all the syntax files we get 1.6M/1.1M. Debian package a stripped build under the name
_nano-tiny_ which bind to _libslang_ instead of _libncurses_,
but it saves only 0.1M mega resident.
In 2015 I made a new test on nano 2.2.6 finding on amd64 3.7M res /
2.6M shared. while on armv7 it is 1.8M/1.2M.
