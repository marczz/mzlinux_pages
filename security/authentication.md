# Multifactor Authentication {#multifactor_authentication}
The authentication factors of a multi-factor authentication scheme may include:
-   __Possession factors__: some physical object in the possession of
    the user, such as a USB stick with a secret token, a bank card, a
    key, etc.
-   __Knowledge factors__: some secret known to the user, such as a
password, PIN, TAN, etc.
-   __Inherence factors__: some physical characteristic of the user
    (biometrics), such as a fingerprint, eye iris, voice, typing
    speed, pattern in key press intervals, etc

## One Time Password - OTP
A one-time password (OTP) is a password that is valid for only one
login session or transaction.
So OTP is not vulnerable to replay attacks.

The OTP may be calculated on a time basis (TOTP) or derived by a
mathematical algorithm or {{< wp "Hash chain" >}} among wich  HOTP.

The OTP may be delivered by SMS, mobile phose, prprietary tokens,
web-based methods, or hardcopy on paper or plastic card.

One-time passwords are vulnerable to phtising and  man-in-the-middle
attacks, and are only secure when used as part of multi-factor
authentication.

TOTP is an algorithm that computes a one-time password from a shared
secret key and the current time.TOTP is an example of a hash-based
message authentication code (HMAC). TOTP is based on HOTP with a timestamp
replacing the incrementing counter.  It combines a secret key with the
current timestamp using a cryptographic hash function to generate a
one-time password. The timestamp typically increases in 30-second
intervals, so passwords generated close together in time from the same
secret key will be equal.

    QubesV3.1BackupDefaults.
    it also explain how to implement a secure
    [salted password hashing](https://crackstation.net/hashing-security.htm).

## Password Hashing
Password hashing is a strategy that uses a single master password that is hashed with a
salt made from the domain of the accessed site to generate a unique password that won't
be cracked if you don't know the master password.

Before using them you may read
[The case against password hashers](https://anarc.at/blog/2017-03-02-password-hashers/)
and
[A short history of password hashers](https://anarc.at/blog/2017-03-02-hashers-history/)
by _Anarcat_. It points out the cryptography havoc of old hashing mechanism _wich is
similar for every hashing use_, the necessity to copy  the username and password from
the hasher to the site, the necessity to reenter all your passwords when you change of
hasher, or from hashing function.

It is also to note that while these passsword hashers are used to avoid you use the same
password for many sites, when it is discovered either on a badly managed site that don't
hash or hash not properly your password and has its data stolen; or if it is stolen when
you type it because you javascript library has been replaced by a malicious one, or
because you type it in an unsecure environment where a key logger steal it; you are
actually giving access not only to one site but to all your private data.

An other problem with password hashers pointed out by _Anarcat_ is that one of their
benefit is to be stateless, serverless. But the sites have different requirements for
the passwords, so the options must be stored and available in every place you use
them. The recent password hashers offer a way to store them in the cloud or other
internet accessible place, even if this information is not sensitive, your hasher is no
longer stateless and don't work offline.

This defect is also object of the paper by Tony Arcieri:
[4 fatal flaws in deterministic password managers
](https://tonyarcieri.com/4-fatal-flaws-in-deterministic-password-managers).


But personally, I still find them usefull in some cases, in the past I was using the
same password for all harmless site, I mean all the shopping sites that you use once or
twice and where you are supposed not entering many critical data. I am a gardener who
buy seeds at many shops, what matter if my credentials are stolen, people will only
learn what I have sown the last years!

But this strategy is still dangerous, may be you use this password also on a site that
can use your credit card or have some sensitive data, if this password is captured on
one site, may be a fake site used for phishing, it is compromised everywhere.

But for these _low value_ sites the password hashers are still an help, you can put the
hash in your password manager and use it as usual, but in an environment where the
password manager is unavailable, and you fill it si not secure to log into its web site,
because you use an unknown computer you can still use the password hasher with the web
interface.


-   [Stanford PwdHash](https://pwdhash.github.io/webs)
    is the oldest password hasher with wide use.
    will come with browser extensions for Firefox, Chrome, Opera and a
    [local javascript stand alone page
    ](https://crypto.stanford.edu/PwdHash/RemotePwdHash/). It still use md5 which is no
    longer considered as secure.
-   There are many other extensions for hashing passwords in Firefox or Chrome that you
    get by looking for _password hasher_ in the extensions search. But many of them are
    limited to one browser, if you use many browsers, many systems or desktop and mobile
    like everyone today, it is of no use. Moreover the extensions are versions
    sensitive, and when you update say Firefox, you will soon or later see that the
    extension is no longer compatible, may be a new version of the extension will pop
    out some time later, but you can you login to your sites in the meantime.

    Some of these extension propose also a standalone javascript solution like
    [passhash-ng](https://github.com/phreaknerd/passhash-ng).
-   [SuperGenpass](https://chriszarate.github.io/supergenpass/) uses as basic method
    javascript bookmarklets that you can use in any javascript enabled browser.
    As it is a trivial script it has also be ported to many
    [alternative implementations
    ](https://github.com/chriszarate/supergenpass/wiki/Implementations)
    including browsers extensions and standalone programs, that will be very usefull to
    open sites in a non javascript enabled browser like elinks, w3m, ewww, ....
    Be aware that SuperGenPass defaults to MD5 with not enough rounds, you should select
    the SHA512 hashing function.
-   [LesPass](https://github.com/lesspass/lesspass) (GPL)
    by  Guillaume Vincent uses [PBKDF2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2)
    key derivation with 100,000 iterations and a hash function sha-256. out of the web
    interface it provides a [cli](https://github.com/lesspass/lesspass/tree/master/cli)
    a firefox and chrome extension and an Androip app.

    A _connected_ version  works by saving your password’s profile, in in database
    hosted by the site or your own server. Of course you have the problem mentioned
    above of being no longer stateless!

    There are also an alternative
    [python cli](https://github.com/mevdschee/lesspass.py),
    a [go implementation](https://github.com/mevdschee/lesspass.go) with a cli and gui,
    and a [php implementation](https://github.com/mevdschee/lesspass.php).

## Pam Memo

### type

-   __account__ performs non-authentication based account management. It
    is typically used to restrict/permit access to a service.
-   __auth__ Firstly, it establishes that the user is who they claim
    to be, Secondly, the module can grant group membership.
-   __password__ used for updating the authentication token associated
    with the user.
-   __session__ things to do before or after authentification

### control

-   __requisite__ -- Failure to authenticate via this module results in immediate denial
    of authentication.
-   __required__ -- Failure also results in denial of authentication, although PAM will
    still call all the other modules listed for this service before denying
    authentication.  For the function to be able to return success to the application
    all `required' modules have to report success.
-   __sufficient__ -- If authentication by this module is successful, PAM will grant
    authentication immediatly.  In the case this module succeed no other stacked module
    is called.
-   __optional__ -- Whether this module succeeds or fails is only significant if it is
    the only module of its type for this service.

### options
-   __use_first_pass__ Use the same password used by the first mechanism that asked for
    a password.
-   __try_first_pass__ This is the same as `use_first_pass', except that if the primary
    password is not valid, it should prompt the user for the password.

For the new syntax:

-   __required__ is equivalent to
    `[new_authtok_reqd=ok ignore=ignore default=bad](success=ok)`
-   __requisite__ is equivalent to
    `[new_authtok_reqd=ok ignore=ignore default=die](success=ok)`
-   __sufficient__ is equivalent to
    `[new_authtok_reqd=done default=ignore](success=done)`
-   __optional__ is equivalent to
    `[new_authtok_reqd=ok default=ignore](success=ok)`

The configuration is in `/etc/pam.d/system-auth`
and `/etc/nsswitch.conf`
