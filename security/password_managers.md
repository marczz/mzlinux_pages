# Keyring

-   [FreeDeskop Secret Service API
    ](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/secret-service/)
    allows client applications to store secrets securely in a service running in the
    user's login session.  *gnome-keyring* and *ksecretservice* are both
    implementations of a Secret Service; {{< iref "#keepassxc" "KeepassXC" >}} can also be
    configured to provide the secret service API.

    Each secret is stored together with lookup attributes and a label. These together
    form an item.  A group of items together form a collection wich is what used to be
    called _keyring_.

    Client applications use lookup attributes to find items.

    A collection can have two states: _unlocked_ where items are accessible for reading
    and modifying, _locked_ where items cannot be read or modified. Some service may
    also define locking state item by item.

    Even if the user access secret by attribute. Each secret has also an _object path_
    which look like:

        /org/freedesktop/secrets/collection/xxxx/iiii

    where `xxxx` is the collection and `iiii` is an auto-generated item specific
    identifier.

    The default collection for client applications to store secrets is available under
    the path:

        /org/freedesktop/secrets/aliases/default

# Desktop password managers

Desktop password managers are usually written in Qt or Gtk+ (or Tk)
and they will eat between 10M and 20M of your resident memory (less if
you truly share the libraries). As they can stay open during a whole
session the memory and swap protection is a primary concern.

A comparison of main features of Password managers is givn in
[Password Management Service - Software Comparison](https://wiki.koumbit.net/PasswordManagementService/SoftwareComparison).

# Web based password manager

-   [w3pw](http://sourceforge.net/projects/w3pw/)
    is a web based password manager written in PHP + MySQL using
    MCrypt for encryption.

# Browser plugins
-   [lastpass](https://lastpass.com/)
    is a Firefox plugin which uses one master password to encrypt your
    data on your PC. _But the encrypted data is stored on lastpass
    site, and you are fully dependent of them to retrieve your
    passwords. You need also to fully trust this proprietary plugin_
    It allows to import/export from/to Firefox, and export to popular
    password managers.<br /> LastPass Pocket allows offline access
    from a USB Key.
    -   [lastpass-cli](https://github.com/lastpass/lastpass-cli) is a
        CLI access to lastpass. It is written in C and runs on
        GNU/Linux, Cygwin and Mac OS X. It is in Debian.
        There is  an online [lpass(1) manpage
        ](https://lastpass.github.io/lastpass-cli/lpass.1.html).
    -   lastpass import in CVS with the format:

            url,type,username,password,hostname,extra,name,grouping
            http://sn,server,server1username,server1password,server1hostname,,Server 1,Server Group A

    -    lastpass and lpass export contains only the fields:

            url,username,password,extra,name,grouping,fav

        the fields are not quoted by default, but the _extra_ that
        contains notes with multiple lines should be quoted.

# Password Hashing
Password hashing is a strategy that uses a single master password that is hashed with a
salt made from the domain of the accessed site to generate a unique password that won't
be cracked if you don't know the master password.

Before using them you may read
[The case against password hashers](https://anarc.at/blog/2017-03-02-password-hashers/)
and
[A short history of password hashers](https://anarc.at/blog/2017-03-02-hashers-history/)
by _Anarcat_. It points out the cryptography havoc of old hashing mechanism _wich is
similar for every hashing use_, the necessity to copy  the username and password from
the hasher to the site, the necessity to reenter all your passwords when you change of
hasher, or from hashing function.

It is also to note that while these passsword hashers are used to avoid you use the same
password for many sites, when it is discovered either on a badly managed site that don't
hash or hash not properly your password and has its data stolen; or if it is stolen when
you type it because you javascript library has been replaced by a malicious one, or
because you type it in an unsecure environment where a key logger steal it; you are
actually giving access not only to one site but to all your private data.

An other problem with password hashers pointed out by _Anarcat_ is that one of their
benefit is to be stateless, serverless. But the sites have different requirements for
the passwords, so the options must be stored and available in every place you use
them. The recent password hashers offer a way to store them in the cloud or other
internet accessible place, even if this information is not sensitive, your hasher is no
longer stateless and don't work offline.

This defect is also object of the paper by Tony Arcieri:
[4 fatal flaws in deterministic password managers
](https://tonyarcieri.com/4-fatal-flaws-in-deterministic-password-managers).


But personally, I still find them usefull in some cases, in the past I was using the
same password for all harmless site, I mean all the shopping sites that you use once or
twice and where you are supposed not entering many critical data. I am a gardener who
buy seeds at many shops, what matter if my credentials are stolen, people will only
learn what I have sown the last years!

But this strategy is still dangerous, may be you use this password also on a site that
can use your credit card or have some sensitive data, if this password is captured on
one site, may be a fake site used for phishing, it is compromised everywhere.

But for these _low value_ sites the password hashers are still an help, you can put the
hash in your password manager and use it as usual, but in an environment where the
password manager is unavailable, and you fill it si not secure to log into its web site,
because you use an unknown computer you can still use the password hasher with the web
interface.


-   [Stanford PwdHash](https://pwdhash.github.io/webs)
    is the oldest password hasher with wide use.
    will come with browser extensions for Firefox, Chrome, Opera and a
    [local javascript stand alone page
    ](https://crypto.stanford.edu/PwdHash/RemotePwdHash/). It still use md5 which is no
    longer considered as secure.
-   There are many other extensions for hashing passwords in Firefox or Chrome that you
    get by looking for _password hasher_ in the extensions search. But many of them are
    limited to one browser, if you use many browsers, many systems or desktop and mobile
    like everyone today, it is of no use. Moreover the extensions are versions
    sensitive, and when you update say Firefox, you will soon or later see that the
    extension is no longer compatible, may be a new version of the extension will pop
    out some time later, but you can you login to your sites in the meantime.

    Some of these extension propose also a standalone javascript solution like
    [passhash-ng](https://github.com/phreaknerd/passhash-ng).
-   [SuperGenpass](https://chriszarate.github.io/supergenpass/) uses as basic method
    javascript bookmarklets that you can use in any javascript enabled browser.
    As it is a trivial script it has also be ported to many
    [alternative implementations
    ](https://github.com/chriszarate/supergenpass/wiki/Implementations)
    including browsers extensions and standalone programs, that will be very usefull to
    open sites in a non javascript enabled browser like elinks, w3m, ewww, ....
    Be aware that SuperGenPass defaults to MD5 with not enough rounds, you should select
    the SHA512 hashing function.
-   [LesPass](https://github.com/lesspass/lesspass) (GPL)
    by  Guillaume Vincent uses [PBKDF2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2)
    key derivation with 100,000 iterations and a hash function sha-256. out of the web
    interface it provides a [cli](https://github.com/lesspass/lesspass/tree/master/cli)
    a firefox and chrome extension and an Androip app.

    A _connected_ version  works by saving your passwordâs profile, in in database
    hosted by the site or your own server. Of course you have the problem mentioned
    above of being no longer stateless!

    There are also an alternative
    [python cli](https://github.com/mevdschee/lesspass.py),
    a [go implementation](https://github.com/mevdschee/lesspass.go) with a cli and gui,
    and a [php implementation](https://github.com/mevdschee/lesspass.php).
