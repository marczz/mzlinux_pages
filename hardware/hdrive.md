See Wikipedia: [SMART Attributes
](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.M.A.R.T.#ATA_S.M.A.R.T._attributes)

The disk's firmware converts the raw value to a normalized value
ranging from 1 to 253. If this normalized value is less than or equal
to the threshold (THRESH), the Attribute is said to have failed

| attribute                   | meaning                                         |

ECC = Error Correcting Code memory is a data storage code for testing
the accuracy of data passing through it.

The raw value of Hardware ECC Recovered as a decimal number represents
a sector count, not an error count. This value rolls over to 0 once
the count reaches about 250 million or low level disk format.

# GPT -  GUID Partition Table {#partition_table}
-   Wikipedia: {{< wp "Master boot record" >}}, {{< wp "GUID Partition Table" >}} (GPT):
    a more modern partitioning scheme, replacing the purpose of the MBR,
    {{< wp "Globally unique identifier" >}} (GID),
    {{< wp "Universally unique identifier" >}} (UUID),
    {{< wp "Unified Extensible Firmware Interface" >}} (UEFI)
    is meant as a replacement for the BIOS firmware interface,
-   The {{< wp "GUID Partition Table" >}} (GPT) is part of
    {{< wp "Unified Extensible Firmware Interface" >}} (UEFI).
    It has numerous advantages over {{< wp "Master boot record"  "MBR" >}} it uses
    {{< wp "Universally unique identifier"  "Universally unique identifier (UUID)" >}}
    also named {{< wp "Globally_Unique_Identifier"  "GUID" >}} for
    partition types, disk, and partitions. It allows a minimum of 128 partition table entries
    so logical and extended partitions are no longer necessary.
    It uses 64-bit LBA for storing Sector numbers  allowing up to 2 ZiB disks,
    and  disks with sectors larger than 512b  which are now common.
    It has backup and crc checksum for header and partition table.<br />
    _fdisk_ does not work with GPT, you have to use *gdisk* or *parted*.

## Bootable SD Card

    explain how to format a SD card for io speed, and compare the speed of diferent file
    system.
-   When using a filesystem on a sd card, we should avoid wearing it off by disabling
    swap, or in raspberry remove `dphys-swapfile`.  using the `noatime` option, highly
    used directories such as `/var/tmp/` can be put in RAM _tmpfs_, putting /var/log in
    RAM is also an option, but we can no longer examine the logs after a crash.  It is
    also possible to disable journaling, but any unwanted dismount will result in data
    loss. On Raspberry 3 we can
    [boot from external USB device
    ](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bootmodes/msd.md)
    but this option is not available with earlier releases.  Using a bigger sd card also
    augment the wear levelling capacity, and so increase the lifetime of sd cards.

    -   [FAQ . Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/faq.html).

An advice given by _mkusb_ manual is if you want to re-use a USB drive previously used
for a booting image, you should wipe the first megabyte it with dd (overwrite with
zeros), otherwise grub-install doesn't want to write into the mbr area, because it
recognizes the CD file system

# Disk Cloning {#disk_cloning}
There are many ways of cloning a disk. We can clone the disk sector by sector; by doing
so the tool has no need to know about the underlying file system. It is nevertheless
possible to skip empty blocks and compress an image. This is the way to clone with
{{< iref "#dd" "dd" >}} and its variants, it can also be an alternative of some
utility when they don't know the file system.

# Hard Disk spindown {#hd_spindown}


-   [spin down USB Hard disk
    ](http://www.nslu2-linux.org/wiki/FAQ/SpinDownUSBHarddisks)
    in [nslu2 wiki](http://www.nslu2-linux.org/wiki/) and the special
    [AutoSpinDown on Seagate FreeAgent
    ](http://www.nslu2-linux.org/wiki/FAQ/DealWithAutoSpinDownOnSeagateFreeAgent)

The number of spinup cycles for a disk is reported by `smartctl -A
<device>`.  A disk is able to spin up/down 30000-50000 times in its
lifetime. It means that if your disk spin up every 10 mn, it will last
no more than one year.

The disk standby or spindown time can be controled with
[hdparm](http://man.cx/hdparm(8) "man.cx hdparm(8)"). You can change
the value by issuing `hdparm -S <n>` where `<n>` means _n_ units of 5s
if _n <= 240_ or _(n-240)*30 minutes_ otherwise.

Then it is carreful to check how much your standby cycle increase with
smartmontool, and you can automate your setting by putting it in
`/etc/hdparm.conf`
~~~~~~~
/dev/sda {
spindown_time = 120
}
~~~~~~~
for a spindown time of 10mn.

It is very often difficult to let your disk spin down. It is kept busy
by daemons, `crond` uses to launch tasks quite often, at least hourly.
So it is usefull to check your `/etc/cron.hourly` directory, and
`/etc/cron.d` to check if your computer truly needs a hourly disk
activity.  Some other daemons that may wake up your disk are your
logging daemon _syslogd or alternative_, network time protocol daemon,
mail transport agent.




Quoting [Lapttop Mode FAQ](http://www.samwel.tk/laptop_mode/faq)
"Desktop hard drives are usually rated for only 40,000-50,000 spinups,
and one spinup every 10 minutes will kill your 40,000-spinup HD in 277
days. So this is NOT recommended for server use, unless you increase
the spinup interval dramatically, to say once every hour or
two. Laptop hard drives are usually rated for around 300,000 spinups,
so those will last about 2083 days or 6 years if you have them powered
on 24-7."

# laptop mode {#laptop_mode}

Bart Samwel has written
[Laptop mode](http://www.samwel.tk/laptop_mode/)
which is a kernel "mode" that allows you to group write activity on your disks, so that only reads of uncached data result in a disk spinup.
It replaces it's older  _Smart Spindown_ script to allow spinning down the hard disk when it is idle and the older
__kernel laptop mode__  which is described in the
[/Documentation/laptops/laptop-mode.txt
](http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/laptops/laptop-mode.txt) file
of the kernel.

You may want to read
[laptop mode faq](http://samwel.tk/laptop_mode/faq)
and learn how _spinning down too many times may kill hard drives_.

Laptop mode is provided by Debian/Ubuntu package
[laptop_mode-tools](http://samwel.tk/laptop_mode/packages/debian).

The heart of the kernel laptop\_mode is the knob
`/proc/sys/vm/laptop_mode`, when it is set to *n* as in:

    sysctl -w vm.laptop_mode=5

any physical disk I/O causes Linux to flush all dirty blocks *n*
seconds after the occurrence of disk I/O.

We can also use `/proc/sys/vm/dirty_expire_centisecs` which define
when dirty data is old enough to be eligible for writeout by the
pdflush daemons. Increasing the value minimize the disk access and
increase the possibility of losing information. But for ext3fs the
journal does not use the pdflush daemon.

The flag `/proc/sys/vm/block_dump` ask the kernel to reports all
disk read and write operations that take place, and all block
dirtying done to files. The result can be accessed in dmesg.

The
[/proc/sys/vm directory
](http://www.linuxinsight.com/proc_sys_vm_hierarchy.html )
_see also [/proc/sys/vm/ kernel.org documentation
](http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt)_
is used to tune the operation of the virtual memory (VM) subsystem
of the Linux kernel and the writeout of dirty data to disk.
