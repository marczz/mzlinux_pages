    is the command line OMX player for the Raspberry PI.

    Omxplayer is deprecated and should be replaced by vlc , his is due to: omxplayer
    uses openvg for OSD and subtitles which isn't supported on Pi4. omxplayer uses
    openmax which has been deprecated for a long time and isn't supported with 64-bit
    kernels. omxplayer does not support software decode omxplayer does not support
    advanced subtitles omxplayer does not support playback from ISO files. omxplayer
    does not integrate with the X desktop.

    Don't miss the keyboard shortcut listed on this page, ore in the
    [Github repository](https://github.com/popcornmix/omxplayer).

    There is no manual, and the command line options are in the usage string (from -h or

# Banana Pi
the information on the bananapi devices are on Wikipedia {{< wp "Banana Pi" >}}
and on the [Banana Pi gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/book/bananapi/).

-   Bananapi M1 has an ArmV7 {{< wp "Allwinner A20" >}} {{< wp "ARM Cortex-A7" >}}
    Dual-Core 1GB DDR3, 10/100/1000 Ethernet, HDMI, CVBS, LVDS/RGB
    Video output, 3.5mm jack and HDMI Audio output, SATA 2.0 (quite
    slow 36MB/s) , 2 x USB
    2.0 ports, the same GPIO headers as the Raspberry Pi 1 Model A &
    B.

    Note That the allwinner A20 was a nice improvement over the first
    single-core Raspberry Pis few years ago but is pretty slow by
    today’s standards. The native SATA is very slow, and the gigabit
    is not fully capable of 940 Mbits/sec in both directions.
    So Armbian suggest now to replace it with better alternatives like
    those listed in [This T. Kaiser post
    ](https://forum.armbian.com/topic/1351-h3-board-buyers-guide/?tab=comments#comment-28169).

-   Bananapi M2 improve CPU with an Allwinner A31S {{< wp "ARM Cortex-A7" >}}
    Quad-Core 1GHz, 4 x USB 2, but drop SATA.
-   Bananapi M2+ CPU is H3 Quad-core {{< wp "ARM Cortex-A7" >}} Quad-Core, one
    USB 2.0 HOST, NO SATA, Wifi,
-   [Bananapi M2 Ultra
    ](https://www.gitbook.com/book/bananapi/bpi-m2-ultra-open-source-single-board-computer/details)
    _November 2016_ has an [Allwinner R40
    ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allwinner_Technology#R-Series)
    {{< wp "ARM Cortex-A7" >}} Quad-Core 2GHz, 2GB DDR3 SDRAM, 8G eMMC flash on
    board, bluetooth 4.0 and SATA interface. The Allwinner R40’s
    advantage over the H3 and A31 is the addition of eMMC flash and
    native SATA support.
-   [Banana PI BPI-M2 Berry
    ](https://www.gitbook.com/book/bananapi/bpi-m2-ultra-open-source-single-board-computer/details)
    has the same [Allwinner R40
    ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allwinner_Technology#R-Series)
    {{< wp "ARM Cortex-A7" >}} Quad-Core 2GHz, 2GB DDR3 SDRAM, bluetooth 4.0 and SATA interface.
    WIFI+BT on board.  The main difference with M2 Ultra is the
    absence of eMMC and the support of Wifi onboard. Ultra has also a
    Built-in 3.7V Lithium Battery Charging Circuit, which is absent on
    Berry.

    Both models have the same size than raspberry and can use the same
    boxes, the 40 pin GPIO header is pin-compatible with Raspberry Pi.
-   Banana Pi M3 _2015_ is an octa-core version of Banana Pi, it
    supports onboard Wi-Fi and SATA Port, but SATA is via an
    innefficient USB to SATA bridge.

# QNAP

[Debian is supported for Qnap orion TS109, TS-209, TS 409](http://www.cyrius.com/debian/orion/qnap/)
and [Qnap Kirkwood 11x, 12x, 21x, 22x, 41x, 42x
](http://www.cyrius.com/debian/kirkwood/qnap/).

With a QNAP 109 you have first to check you have
[recovery mode](http://www.cyrius.com/debian/orion/qnap/ts-109/recovery.html) then you will find the installation procedure in the page
[Installing Debian on the QNAP TS-109](http://www.cyrius.com/debian/orion/qnap/ts-109/install.html).
You can also look at some
[Debian installation screenshoots](http://wiki.qnap.com/wiki/Debian_Installation_On_QNAP "wiki.qnap.com Debian_Installation_On_QNAP" )
on the Qnap wiki or in the
[Harryd's blog](http://harryd71.blogspot.com/2008/09/installing-debian-on-qnap-ts-209.htm "harryd71.blogspot.com installing-debian-on-qnap-ts-209.htm").


Once we can ssh to the box we can continue following the [Debian GNU/Linux Installation Guide for arm](http://www.debian.org/releases/lenny/arm/) by using the orion5x build.

For my Qnap I use a lvm formatted disk. Lvm support is missing in the Qnap provided kernel..

# Debian on Buffalo Nas

Linkstation Pro and Live and KuroBox are based on an Orion chip, like are Qnap TS109, TS-209, TS 409.

    on *nas-central*.

Linkstation are now based on Marvell ARMADA 370 processor (1.2GH, 512M DDR3)
which is like a Kirkwood but with ARMv6/v7 (instead of ARMv5).Synology
use the same processor for its NAS, and we can at least
[run in a chroot

# Excito Bubba

Excito Bubba line of NAS were running  Debian Squeeze

[Excito Bubba 3
](http://www.excito.com/bubba/products/technical-specifications.html)
features 1.2GHz ARM processor, 512MB RAM, 1 x internal 2"5 or 3"5 sata
drive bay, 2 Gigabit Ethernet, 2x USB2, 1 e-sata, optional wifi, 115 x
45 x 185 mm, 5-13W power consumption, fanless, run Debian Squeeze.

At _autumn 2013_ Excito changed focus to make hardware and software
platforms for the digital home, which they sell to operators. So the
Development of Bubba software is stalled to a squeeze release with a
2.6 Kernel;


[Excito wiki](http://wiki.excito.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page)
is the primary source for Bubba related tutorials and how-tos.

The members of Excito that were developping this line of product have
moved to [OpenProduct](http://openproducts.se/) which is prepping a
tiny (105x105x25mm) Ubuntu-based private file and email server called
OPI ([technical specifications

with Cortex A8 processor, 512MB RAM, LUKS-based microSD encryption,
and optional USB or cloud backup
