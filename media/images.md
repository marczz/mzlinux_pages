{{< wp "Raster graphics" >}}, {{< wp "Comparison of graphics file formats" >}}
which includes
{{< wp "Comparison_of_graphics_file_formats#Technical_details" "technical details" >}}.

The most popular formats for bitmap are:

Uncompressed lossless formats
:

-   [BMP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format), [BMP format file structure
    ](http://www.fileformat.info/format/bmp/egff.htm). 1, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 32-bits
    bitmaps format from microsoft
-   <a name="pnm"></a>[PPM, PGM, PBM, PNM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm_format),
    [netpbm: PPM](http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/ppm.html) pixmap,
    [PGM](http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/pgm.html) graymap,
    [PBM](http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/pbm.html) bitmap,
    [PAM](http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/pam.html) _Portable Arbitrary Map_ can

    replace  PBM,  PPM, PGM, PPM.
    [PNM](http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/pam.html) anymap, not a true format but any
    of PBM,  PPM, PGM, PPM.

Compressed lossless formats
:

-   [GIF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Interchange_Format),
    is a LZW lossless data compression bit image format, LZW was covered by patents, but
    they expired in 2004. PNG developped to overcome the LZW patents largely replace GIF
    but [Animated GIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF#Animated_GIF)
    are still widely used.
-   {{< iref "#jxr" "JPEG XR" >}}  can do lossless or lossy compression.
-   {{< iref "#openexr" "openEXR" >}}  can do lossless or lossy compression.
-   [PNG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics),
    [Portable Network Graphics (PNG) Specification
    ](https://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-PNG-20031110),
    [Portable Network Graphics Home Page](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/)
-   [ ] <a name="tiff"></a>[TIFF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIFF)
    The TIFF image format is widely used for scanning, faxing, word processing, optical
    character recognition.  It can save multi-page documents to a single TIFF file.

    Tiff allows different [compression schemes
    ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIFF#TIFF_Compression_Tag)
    CCITT T.4 (i.e group3) and T.6 (i.e group4), JBIG, JBIG2 bi-level encodings; LZW,
    {{< wp "Deflate" >}} (i.e. Zip), JPEG2000 . JPEG is also allowed making in this case
    a lossy format.

    Multiple  images tiff files can be splited or combined with
    {{< iref "#libtiff" "libtiff-tools" >}}, or even by
    {{< iref "#graphicsmagick" "GraphicsMagick" >}}/{{< iref "#imagemagick" "ImageMagic" >}}
    but these two last will use a lot of memory by loading all pages.

    Multiple  images tiff can be displayed only by some viewers like
    {{< iref "#imview" "imview" >}} and  {{< iref "ps_pdf_djvu#evince" "evince"  >}} .

-   [Multiple-image Network Graphics (MNG)
    ](http://www.libmng.com/pub/mng/index.html)
    A PNG-like Image Format Supporting Animation and Transparent JPEG

-  <a name="sixel"></a><a class="WpRef" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixel"
   title="Wikipedia - Sixel">Sixel</a>
   is a bitmap graphics format supported by terminals and printers from DEC. It consists
   of a pattern six pixels high and one wide, resulting in 64 possible patterns. Each
   possible pattern is assigned an ASCII character. (more
   <a class="WpRef" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixel"
   title="Wikipedia - Sixel">on Wikipedia</a>).

   Sixel was the format
   [used in the dec vt320](https://www.vt100.net/dec/vt320/soft_characters)
   to transmit glyphs.

   Many terminal applications are supporting sixel, like blackbox, eat, foot, mlterm, st
   with a patch, xfce-terminal, xterm (in vt340 mode since aout 2020), any web terminal
   built upon xterm.js with the image add-on, wezterm, yaft (framebuffer terminal),
   yakuake.

   See [sixel for terminal graphics](https://konfou.xyz/posts/sixel-for-terminal-graphics/)
   for how to set *xterm* and display sixel graphics.

   In 2024 all the vte based terminals, i.e gnome-terminal and sisters, are not sixel
   compatible, neither some popular terminals like alacrity, kitty, konsole, urxvt, ...

   An up to date list is in the page
   [Are We Sixel Yet?](https://www.arewesixelyet.com/).

Lossy Formats
:

-   [JPEG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG ),
    {{< wp "JPEG" >}} is a method of compression for images, __jpeg/exif__ is
    the most common image format used by digital cameras.
-   {{< wp "JPEG 2000" >}} an enhancement of JPEG with the same level of compression
    but a greater flexibility allowing to lower the resolution without transcoding; at
    the price of additional computing complexity.
    -   [OpenJPEG](http://www.openjpeg.org/) is a BSD licence JPEG 2000 codec written in
        C.
        _ libopenjp2-tools_ is in Debian.
-   <a name="jxr"> {{< wp "JPEG XR" >}} (BSD License) a lossy or lossless format for
    photographic images. Computation can be done using only integer computations.
    The Compression is better than JPEG, and lossless compression is available. There is
    also a better color support, and the container is TIFF compatible.
    _libjxr-tools_ is packaged in Debian.
-   <a name="openEXR">{{< wp "OpenEXR" >}} a BSD licenced high dynamic range raster file
    format. It can do lossless or lossy compression.
    -   [OpenEXR Home](https://www.openexr.com/)
    -   Debian provides _openexr_ tools.
-   {{< iref "#tiff" "TIFF"  >}} when used with jpeg compression is a lossy format.
-   {{< wp "WebP" >}} is an open image format developped by Google
    both with lossless and lossy compression. Google tests show an
    improvement in size of roughly 25% both in lossless format tested
    against _png_ and lossy format compared to _jpeg_.
    -   [Google WebP page](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/)
    -   _WebP_ is supported by
        browsers as _Chromium_, _Opera_, and an implementation is going on for
        _WebKit_ and _Mozilla_ based browsers.
    -   Image editors as _Gimp_ and
        _{{< iref "#imagemagick" "ImageMagic" >}}_, _but not yet GraphicsMagick_
        have also support for _WebP_
    -   Among viewers _Gthumb_ supports _WebP_. There is a
        [WebP plugin for imlib2](https://github.com/gawen947/imlib2-webp)
        so _imlib2_ based software
        like {{< iref "#feh" "feh" >}} or
        {{< iref "#sxiv" "sxiv" >}}
        should display the _WebP_ format.

Bi-levels Formats
:

    These are formats to encode binary images, or Black and White images. These are
    efficients algorithms which are allowed to embed images in pdf or djvu.

    -   {{< wp "Group_4_compression" "CCITT Group 4 compression" >}} or G4
        is a lossless compression used in Group 4 fax machines, or for PDF image
        embedding.  {{< iref "#imagemagick" "ImageMagick" >}} or
         {{< iref "#graphicmagick" "GraphicMagick" >}} can produce G4 images.
    -   {{< wp "JBIG2"  >}} is a lossless or lossy compression used for PDF embedding.
        It allows a lossless compression  3â€“5 times smaller than Group 4.
        It is similar to the JB2 compression used in
        {{< iref "ps_pdf_djvu#djvu" "DjVu" >}}.
        More {{< iref "ps_pdf_djvu#jbig2" "references on JBig2 in the PDF section" >}}.

# Color Management

An [ICC profile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_profile) is describe the color
attributes of a particular device or viewing requirement by defining a bidirectional
mapping between the device source or target color space and a profile connection space
(PCS).

You can find exemple of ICC profiles in the [ICC profiles provided by
Adobe](https://supportdownloads.adobe.com/detail.jsp?ftpID=4075), if you have installed
the colord package many profiles are installed under `/usr/share/color/icc/`.

    ](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ICC_profiles#Gnome_Color_Manager)


# Image metadata

{{< wp "Exchangeable_image_file_format"  "EXIF" >}} or _Exchangeable image file format_
is a specification for the image file format used by digital cameras.
The unofficial site of EXIF is [EXIF.org](http://www.exif.org/).

{{< wp "EXtensible Metadata Platform" >}} (XMP) is a standard, created by Adobe,
for processing and storing standardized and proprietary
information relating to the contents of a file.  XMP can be used in
several file formats such as PDF, JPEG, JPEG 2000, JPEG XR, GIF, PNG,
HTML, TIFF, Adobe Illustrator, PSD, MP3, MP4, Audio Video Interleave,
WAV, RF64, Audio Interchange File Format, PostScript, Encapsulated
PostScript, and proposed for DjVu. In a typical edited JPEG file, XMP
information is typically included alongside Exif and IPTC Information
Interchange Model data.

The [IPTC core schema for XMP](http://www.iptc.org/IPTC4XMP/)
can store in XMP header information originally part of
{{< wp "IPTC Information Interchange Model" >}}.
The [IPTC core shema specification
](http://www.iptc.org/std/photometadata/specification/IPTC-PhotoMetadata-201007_1.pdf)
describe the name and role of tags used in IPTC.

## Metatada manipulation programs

Some general image manipulation program can access the exif data stored in jpeg images,
like GIMP, ImageMagic and GraphicksMagic. Number of viewers can also display exif data:
geekie, eog, fbi, gtkam, gphoto2, ristretto.... .

But  only few program that can __write exif__ , among them GIMP,
{{< iref "#imagemagick" "ImageMagic" >}},
{{< iref "#graphicsmagick" "GraphicsMagic" >}}, {{< iref "#exif" "exif" >}},

    controlled via command-line arguments and keyboard/mouse actions.
    _feh_ can also be used as an image browser or to set the
    background wallpaper.
    Feh is one of the leaner image viewers 10.5M resident/ 8.7M shared
    for a small png thumbnail.
    Less than even the standard lxde _Gpicview._ Even on my image test
    directory it takes only 19M/9M, you can compare with _geeqie_,
    _gthumb_, or even the _pqiv_ command line. It's only contender is
    {{< iref "#sxiv" "sxiv" >}}.

    -   A summary of feh capacities is given on the

    is a fork of the older [gqview](http://gqview.sourceforge.net/),
    It is a gtk3 based image viewer, it does not requires gnome as many of
    its concurrent gtk browsers like **eog**. It is
    suited for photo collection maintenance: it allows viewing tags Exif/IPTC/XMP, it is
    feature we harly find in other image viewers, for which you have to rely on an
    external tool to view tags.

    It has a medium footprint less than {{< iref "#gthumb" "Gthumb" >}}
    and above the lighter {{< iref "#feh" "feh" >}} or
    _Gpicview_.  30 M resident/25 M shared at start moving to 93M/27M
    on my image test directory. Like gthumb it does not garbage
    collect and the footprints are always increasing during a session.

    It seems than on wayland, it does not autodetect the gdk backend, so you have to
    make sure that the environment variable `GDK_BACKEND=wayland` is set.

    -   Gthumb start at 70M resident / 49M like geeqie, it grows fast depending of the
        images displayed, but I have observed a better garbage collection than in the
        case of geeqie, for the same image directory gthumb grow to 151M/70M and it
        doesn't seem to shrink when moving to small or even empty directory.

## Terminal image display
On a <a class="iref" href="#sixel" title="internal reference">sixel enabled terminal</a>
you can display sixel images by just using `cat img.six`.


Terminal like Kitty, iTerm2, wezterm, konsole and vscode, offer high resolution
images in 24bit colors.you will use an appropriate viewer. These terminal use each their
own custom image protocol, and offer their own viewer.

The MacOs terminal iterm2 implement a custom [Inline Images Protocol
](https://iterm2.com/documentation-images.html) which extends the xterm protocol with a
set of proprietary escape sequences. This specific protocol is also available on wezterm
and konsole. Using this protocol we can display an image by
```sh
(printf "\e]1337;File=inline=1:" ; base64 -w0 image.jpg  ; printf "\a\n")
```

Kitty has also adopted a custom {Kitty terminal graphics protocol

which can also be used in wezterm, konsole, wayst.
Many programs can use this protocol like timg, chafa, ranger, mpv, viu, some neovim
plugins ect *see the list on the [protocol page
](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/graphics-protocol/)*.


Some viewer like timg work with many protocol.

-   [catimg](https://github.com/posva/catimg/) (MIT License)
    is a C program that display jpeg, png, gif images in the terminal using ascii or
    unicode characters.

    The repository include also the [catimg bash script
    ](https://github.com/posva/catimg/blob/master/catimg)
    that use imagemagick convert to display the image. The script is more accurate
    concerning colors but considerably slower, than the C version which is very fast.

    The work of catimg is explained [in the author blog
    ](https://posva.net/shell/retro/bash/2013/05/27/catimg).

    I have not done a careful benchmark, but for some examples I found catimg 7.7 faster
    than timg.

-   [Chafa](https://hpjansson.org/chafa/) (LGPL-3.0)
    is a terminal image viewer. It has support for the Sixels, Kitty, iTerm2 protocols,
    and most popular image formats, including animated GIFs.
    -   [Man page for Chafa](https://hpjansson.org/chafa/man/)
    -   [chafa - GitHub](https://github.com/hpjansson/chafa)

-   [timg](https://github.com/hzeller/timg) (GPL-2.0)
    A C++ terminal image and video viewer.

    It has support for half block characters, quarter block, sixel, kitty-protocol,
    iTerm2 protocol

    It uses sixel when it is available, but it I have noted that on *foot terminal*
    timg do not use sixel by default and you have to use it with:
    ```sh
    timg -p sixel <image>
    ```

    On terminals with high resolution display like Kitty, iTerm2, konsole timg can use
    the high res format.

    timg can display animated gif, but not webp animations.

    It can also display a pdf page, the result on a sixel enabled terminal, or kitty, is
    very nice with a pdf containing images.

    It can also display videos.

    timg has many options to control the image display.

    (Open Source free [custom license](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/license.php))
    is an image display and manipulation tool for the X Window System.

    In 2025 it seems that neither Image Magick, nor Graphics Magick can use wayland,
    which means that *display* uses XWayland, and import cannot import wayland windows.

    Image Magick can read and write
    [many format](https://imagemagick.org/script/formats.php#supported) among which:
    BPM, EPS, EXR, FAX (G3, G4), GIF, JBIG, JPEG, JPEG-2000 (PGX), JXR i.e. _JPEG-XR_,
    MPEG (M2V, M4V, MKV, MOV, MPG, WMV), Photo CD (PCD), PDF, PNG, PNM (PBM, PPM, PGM,
    PAM), PS (level II and III), RGB, SVG, TIFF, XPM, WEBP, YUV image formats.

    It can resize, rotate, sharpen, color reduce, add special effects, convert an image,
    and creates animated or transparent .gifs, composite images, or thumbnail images.

    _ImageMagick_ includes the following command line tools:

    [animate](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/animate.php)
    :   animate an image sequence on an X server.

    [compare](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/compare.php)
    :   annotate the difference between an image and its reconstruction.

    [composite](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/composite.php)
    :   overlap one image over another.

    [conjure](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/conjure.php)
    :   interpret and execute scripts written in the Magick Scripting Language (MSL).

    [convert](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/convert.php)
    :   convert between image formats as well as resize an image, blur, crop, despeckle,
        dither, draw on, flip, join, re-sample, and more.

    [display](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/display.php)
    :   display an image or image sequence on an X server.

    [identify](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/identify.php)
    :   describe the format and characteristics of one or more image files.

    [import](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/import.php)
    :   save any visible window on an X server as an image file. You can capture a
        single window, the entire screen, or any rectangular portion of the screen.

    [mogrify](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/mogrify.php)
    :   resize an image, blur, crop, despeckle, dither, draw on, flip, join, re-sample,
        and much more. Mogrify overwrites the original image file, whereas _convert_
        writes to a different image file.

    [montage](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/montage.php)
    :   create a composite image by combining several separate images.  The images are
        tiled on the composite image optionally adorned with a border, frame, image
        name, and more.

    [stream](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/stream.php)
    :   stream one or more pixel components of the image or portion of the image to your
        choice of storage formats. It writes the pixel components as they are read from
        the input image a row at a time making `stream` desirable when working with
        large images or when you require raw pixel components.
