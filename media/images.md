Among {{< wp " image file formats" >}}.
this section deals with _raster_ or _bitmap_ file formats, the _vector_
file formats are in the
{{< iref "#svg" "SVG section" >}},
and the {{< iref "ps_pdf_djvu" "PDF and Postscript section" >}}. They are
compared in the Wikipedia page {{< wp "Comparison of graphics file formats" >}}.


# Image formats

Wikipedia: {{< wp "Image_file_formats#Raster_formats" "Raster File Formats" >}},
{{< wp "Raster graphics" >}}, {{< wp "Comparison of graphics file formats" >}}
which includes
{{< wp "Comparison_of_graphics_file_formats#Technical_details" "technical details" >}}.

The most popular formats for bitmap are:

Uncompressed lossless formats
:

-   [BMP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format), [BMP format file structure
    ](http://www.fileformat.info/format/bmp/egff.htm). 1, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 32-bits
    bitmaps format from microsoft
-   <a name="pnm"></a>[PPM, PGM, PBM, PNM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm_format),
    [netpbm: PPM](http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/ppm.html) pixmap,
    [PGM](http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/pgm.html) graymap,
    [PBM](http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/pbm.html) bitmap,
    [PAM](http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/pam.html) _Portable Arbitrary Map_ can
    replace  PBM,  PPM, PGM, PPM.
    [PNM](http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/pam.html) anymap, not a true format but any
    of PBM,  PPM, PGM, PPM.

Compressed lossless formats
:

-   [GIF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Interchange_Format),
-   {{< iref "#jxr" "JPEG XR" >}}  can do lossless or lossy compression.
-   {{< iref "#openexr" "openEXR" >}}  can do lossless or lossy compression.
-   [PNG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics),
    [Portable Network Graphics (PNG) Specification
    ](https://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-PNG-20031110),
    [Portable Network Graphics Home Page](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/)
-   <a name="tiff"></a>[TIFF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIFF)
    The TIFF image format is widely used for scanning, faxing, word processing, optical
    character recognition.  It can save multi-page documents to a single TIFF file.

    Tiff allows different [compression schemes
    ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIFF#TIFF_Compression_Tag)
    CCITT T.4 (i.e group3) and T.6 (i.e group4), JBIG, JBIG2 bi-level encodings; LZW,
    {{< wp "Deflate" >}} (i.e. Zip), JPEG2000 . JPEG is also allowed making in this case
    a lossy format.

    Multiple  images tiff files can be splited or combined with
    {{< iref "#libtiff" "libtiff-tools" >}}, or even by
    {{< iref "#graphicsmagick" "GraphicsMagick" >}}/{{< iref "#Imagemagick" "ImageMagic" >}}
    but these two last will use a lot of memory by loading all pages.

    Multiple  images tiff can be displayed only by some viewers like
    {{< iref "#imview" "imview" >}} and  {{< iref "ps_pdf_djvu#evince" "evince"  >}} .

-   [Multiple-image Network Graphics (MNG)
    ](http://www.libmng.com/pub/mng/index.html)
    A PNG-like Image Format Supporting Animation and Transparent JPEG

Lossy Formats
:

-   [JPEG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG ),
    {{< wp "JPEG" >}} is a method of compression for images, __jpeg/exif__ is
    the most common image format used by digital cameras.
-   {{< wp "JPEG 2000" >}} an enhancement of JPEG with the same level of compression
    but a greater flexibility allowing to lower the resolution without transcoding; at
    the price of additional computing complexity.
    -   [OpenJPEG](http://www.openjpeg.org/) is a BSD licence JPEG 2000 codec written in
        C.
        _ libopenjp2-tools_ is in Debian.
-   <a name="jxr"> {{< wp "JPEG XR" >}} (BSD License) a lossy or lossless format for
    photographic images. Computation can be done using only integer computations.
    The Compression is better than JPEG, and lossless compression is available. There is
    also a better color support, and the container is TIFF compatible.
    _libjxr-tools_ is packaged in Debian.
-   <a name="openEXR">{{< wp "OpenEXR" >}} a BSD licenced high dynamic range raster file
    format. It can do lossless or lossy compression.
    -   [OpenEXR Home](https://www.openexr.com/)
    -   Debian provides _openexr_ tools.
-   {{< iref "#tiff" "TIFF"  >}} when used with jpeg compression is a lossy format.
-   {{< wp "WebP" >}} is an open image format developped by Google
    both with lossless and lossy compression. Google tests show an
    improvement in size of roughly 25% both in lossless format tested
    against _png_ and lossy format compared to _jpeg_.
    -   [Google WebP page](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/)
    -   _WebP_ is supported by
        browsers as _Chromium_, _Opera_, and an implementation is going on for
        _WebKit_ and _Mozilla_ based browsers.
    -   Image editors as _Gimp_ and
        _{{< iref "#Imagemagick" "ImageMagic" >}}_, _but not yet GraphicsMagick_
        have also support for _WebP_
    -   Among viewers _Gthumb_ supports _WebP_. There is a
        [WebP plugin for imlib2](https://github.com/gawen947/imlib2-webp)
        so _imlib2_ based software
        like {{< iref "#feh" "feh" >}} or
        {{< iref "#sxiv" "sxiv" >}}
        should display the _WebP_ format.

Bi-levels Formats
:

    These are formats to encode binary images, or Black and White images. These are
    efficients algorithms which are allowed to embed images in pdf or djvu.

    -   {{< wp "Group_4_compression" "CCITT Group 4 compression" >}} or G4
        is a lossless compression used in Group 4 fax machines, or for PDF image
        embedding.  {{< iref "#imagemagick" "ImageMagick" >}} or
         {{< iref "#graphicmagick" "GraphicMagick" >}} can produce G4 images.
    -   {{< wp "JBIG2"  >}} is a lossless or lossy compression used for PDF embedding.
        It allows a lossless compression  3â€“5 times smaller than Group 4.
        It is similar to the JB2 compression used in
        {{< iref "ps_pdf_djvu#djvu" "DjVu" >}}.
        More {{< iref "ps_pdf_djvu#jbig2" "references on JBig2 in the PDF section" >}}.

# Color Management

An [ICC profile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_profile) is describe the color
attributes of a particular device or viewing requirement by defining a bidirectional
mapping between the device source or target color space and a profile connection space
(PCS).

You can find exemple of ICC profiles in the [ICC profiles provided by
Adobe](https://supportdownloads.adobe.com/detail.jsp?ftpID=4075), if you have installed
the colord package many profiles are installed under `/usr/share/color/icc/`.

# Image metadata

{{< wp "Exchangeable_image_file_format"  "EXIF" >}} or _Exchangeable image file format_
is a specification for the image file format used by digital cameras.
The unofficial site of EXIF is [EXIF.org](http://www.exif.org/).

{{< wp "EXtensible Metadata Platform" >}} (XMP) is a standard, created by Adobe,
for processing and storing standardized and proprietary
information relating to the contents of a file.  XMP can be used in
several file formats such as PDF, JPEG, JPEG 2000, JPEG XR, GIF, PNG,
HTML, TIFF, Adobe Illustrator, PSD, MP3, MP4, Audio Video Interleave,
WAV, RF64, Audio Interchange File Format, PostScript, Encapsulated
PostScript, and proposed for DjVu. In a typical edited JPEG file, XMP
information is typically included alongside Exif and IPTC Information
Interchange Model data.

The [IPTC core schema for XMP](http://www.iptc.org/IPTC4XMP/)
can store in XMP header information originally part of
{{< wp "IPTC Information Interchange Model" >}}.
The [IPTC core shema specification
](http://www.iptc.org/std/photometadata/specification/IPTC-PhotoMetadata-201007_1.pdf)
describe the name and role of tags used in IPTC.

## Metatada manipulation programs Some general image manipulation
program can access the exif data stored in jpeg images, like GIMP,
ImageMagic and GraphicksMagic. Number of viewers can also display exif
data: geekie, eog, fbi, gtkam, gphoto2, ristretto.... .

But  only few program that can __write exif__ , among them GIMP,
{{< iref "#imagemagick" "ImageMagic" >}},
{{< iref "#graphicsmagick" "GraphicsMagic" >}},
exif, gexif,  exiv2, and exiftools.

-   [Exiftags](http://johnst.org/sw/exiftags/) (BSD Licence)
-   [exiftran](http://linux.bytesex.org/fbida/)

-   [Exiftool](http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/)
    is a perl library plus a command-line application for reading,
    and writing many metadata  in  image, audio and video files.
    The [wikimedia commons: Exif
    ](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:EXIF)
    page contains information of use of exif at Commons with exemple
    showing how to set a copyright and licensing information
    with _exiftools_.
-   [Exiv2](http://www.exiv2.org/) (GPL)
    is a C++ library and a command line utility to manage image
    metadata. It can read and __write__ Exif,
    IPTC and XMP metadata.<br />

# Image display

-   [xwd(1)](http://man.cx/xwd(1)) dump an image of an X window
-   [xloadimage(1)](http://man.cx/xloadimage(1))
    load images into an X11 window or onto the root window
-   {{< man "edisplay" >}} is the viewer provided by
    {{< iref "#exactimage" "Exact Image" >}}
-   <a name="fbida"></a>[fbida](http://linux.bytesex.org/fbida/)
    contains __fbi__ an image viewer for framebuffer console, _ida_ a
    small motif-based image viewer. _fbgs_ is a wrapper script to
    display PostScript or pdf using _fbi_ on a framebuffer
    console. __Exiftran__ does lossless transformations of JPEG
    images, preserving exif data.  (`jpegtran` instead ignore them)
-   <a name="feh"></a>[feh](http://feh.finalrewind.org/)
    is a CLI-based X11 image viewer using the imlib2 library.  It is
    controlled via command-line arguments and keyboard/mouse actions.
    _feh_ can also be used as an image browser or to set the
    background wallpaper.
    Feh is one of the leaner image viewers 10.5M resident/ 8.7M shared
    for a small png thumbnail.
    Less than even the standard lxde _Gpicview._ Even on my image test
    directory it takes only 19M/9M, you can compare with _geeqie_,
    _gthumb_, or even the _pqiv_ command line. It's only contender is
    {{< iref "#sxiv" "sxiv" >}}.

    -   A summary of feh capacities is given on the
        [Feh page of the previous maintener
        ](http://linuxbrit.co.uk/software/feh/).

    scroll your images.
-   <a name="geekie"></a>[Geeqie](http://geeqie.org/) (GPL)
    is a fork of the older
    [gqview](http://gqview.sourceforge.net/),
    is a gtk (2 or 3) based image viewer, it does not requires gnome as many of
    its concurrent gtk browsers like **eog**. It is
    suited for photo collection maintenance: raw format, Exif/IPTC/XMP
    has a medium footprint less than
    {{< iref "#gthumb" "Gthumb" >}} and above the lighter
    {{< iref "#feh" "feh" >}} or
    _Gpicview_.  30 M resident/25 M shared at start moving to 93M/27M
    on my image test directory. Like gthumb it does not garbage
    collect and the footprints are always increasing during a session.
    -   [Geeqie github repository
        ](https://github.com/BestImageViewer/geeqie)
-   [Gpicview](http://wiki.lxde.org/en/GPicView) (GPL)
    is a lightweight and fast image viewer for GTK+ 2.x. It has
    minimal dependencies and is quite lean 16M resident / 14M shared
    (without loaded image), it has no directory browsing capability
    and the version tested (0.2.5) has a bug that prevent to load all the jpeg
    of my test directory, so I cannot compare on my image directory, displaying
    only one jpeg of this directory it takes 32M/19M. By its
    footprints it is in the top range of GTK viewers, of course with
    an interface less user friendly than bigger viewer software.
    It is the standard picture viewer of LXDE, but has minimal
    dependencies using only GTK2 and glib2, and is desktop independant.
-   <a name="gthumb"></a>{{< wp "Gthumb" >}} (GPL) is an image viewer and
    organizer. It belongs to gnome but it has very mild gnome
    dependencies and is more a GTK+ software. Its features include
    filesystem browsing, slide show, image catalogs, web album
    creation, camera import, image CD burning, batch file operations
    and quick image editing features like metadata display and
    edition, transformation and color manipulationColor Adjustments,
    resizing and cropping, rotations and flips.
    -   [Gthumb Home](https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Apps/gthumb)
    -   [Gthumb Help](https://help.gnome.org/users/gthumb/stable/)
    -   Gthumb start at 70M resident / 49M like geeqie, it grows fast
        depending of the images displayed, but I have observed a
        better garbage collection than in the case of geeqie, for the
        same image directory gthumb grow to 151M/70M and it doesn't
        seem to shrink when moving to small or even empty directory.
        _I noticed garbage collection on a previous version, but with
        the new one tested 3.4.4 it does no more happen._
-   {{< iref "#graphickmagick" "Graphics Magick" >}}
    provide a command to display images. `gm display`.
-   {{< iref "#imagemagick" "ImageMagick" >}} display images
    with its command `display`.
-   <a name="imview"></a>[imview
    ](http://hugues.zahlt.info/software_imview.html)
    is an X11 image viewer, with limited editing capabilities.  It can
    display multiple pages tiff files. It uses no desktop environment,
    only bare X. The 1.1.9h version is from 2009, Debian use 1.1.9C
    from 2008, it is now minimally maintained. It has small memory
    footprints 9.5M resident / 8.5M shared. When loading all files from
    my test directory the memory footprint is 43M / 14M
-   {{< wp "libjpeg"  "LibJpeg" >}} contains the following utilities: `cjpeg` and
    `djpeg`, for performing file formats conversions, `rdjpgcom` and
    `wrjpgcom`, for inserting and extracting textual comments in JFIF
    files, `jpegtran` for lossless transcoding between different JPEG
    formats.
-   [lsix](https://github.com/hackerb9/lsix)
    Shows thumbnails of images in a directory in terminal using {{< wp "Sixel" >}}
    graphics.  It is a bash script that uses {{< iref "#imagemagick" "ImageMagick" >}}
    for displaying images.
-   [Mirage](http://mirageiv.sourceforge.net/)
    is a Python/GTK  image viewer. It allow also simple image
    manipulation: rotating at 90-degree, flipping
    horizontally/vertically, resizing, cropping, and saturation.
    We can also define custom actions using shell commands and
    external executables.

    As every interpreted software the
    footprints are including the interpreter load so it
    weight 43M resident / 28M shared. This is still mild requirement
    compared to gthumb, on my test image directory it grows to
    100M/31M.

    -   [Mirage Documentation
        ](http://mirageiv.sourceforge.net/docs.html)

-   <a name="pqiv"></a>[PQIV](https://github.com/phillipberndt/pqiv)

    It is an image viewer written in C using GTK 2 or GTK 3 and
    GLIB 2. It is actively maintained in 2020, and is in Debian.
    It start at 26M resident / 21M shared on a small thumbnail,
    and browsing my image test directory 64M / 21M.
-   <a name="qiv"></a>[QIV - Quick Image Viewer](http://spiegl.de/qiv/)
    (GPL) is a gdk/Imlib2 image viewer. it is in Debian.
    Development of _qiv_ stopped in 2013, but it continues in
    {{< iref "#pqiv" "PQIV" >}}.
-   [Ristretto
    ](http://goodies.xfce.org/projects/applications/ristretto)
    is a fast and lightweight picture-viewer for the Xfce desktop environment.
-   <a name="sxiv"></a>[sxiv](https://github.com/muennich/sxiv)
    is a lightweight and scriptable image viewer written in C.
    Its only dependency besides xlib is imlib2. It is in Debian.
    Iis an alternative to {{< iref "#feh" "feh" >}},
    {{< iref "#qiv" "qiv" >}} or
    {{< iref "#pqiv" "pqiv" >}}.

    It start at 5.7M / 4.7M on a small png thumbnail and 20M /5M
    browsing my test image directory (34M / 5M when also making
    thumbnails). For those who want a very lean image viewer, it is
    the only contender to {{< iref "#feh" "feh" >}} among the
    viewer I tested.

_Notes_
:   _The memory footprints comparisons in this section are done by
    loading in the viewer a 4K png icon (emblem-debian.png 128x128)_

:   _The test image directory contains 23 jpegs of around 1MB for a

    :   overlap one image over another.
    [conjure](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/conjure.php)
    :   interpret and execute scripts written in the Magick Scripting
        Language (MSL).

    :   convert between image formats as well as resize an image, blur,
        crop, despeckle, dither, draw on, flip, join, re-sample, and
        more.
    [display](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/display.php)

    [mogrify](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/mogrify.php)
    :   resize an image, blur, crop, despeckle, dither, draw on, flip, join,
        re-sample, and much more. Mogrify overwrites the original image
        file, whereas _convert_ writes to a different image file.
    [montage](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/montage.php)
    :   create a composite image by combining several separate images.
        The images are tiled on the composite image optionally adorned

    [stream](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/stream.php)
    :   stream one or more pixel components of the image or portion of
        the image to your choice of storage formats. It writes the
        pixel components as they are read from the input image a row
        at a time making `stream` desirable when working with large
        images or when you require raw pixel components.
