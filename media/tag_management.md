# Cue, bookmarks, Audiobooks
## Cue sheet {#cuesheet}
A {{< wp "Cue_sheet_(computing)"  "Cue sheet" >}} is a metadata file which
describes how the tracks of a CD or DVD are laid out. For audio files
they are usefull when a big record contain many titles. Quite few
Linux music players support Cue sheets: {{< iref "media_players#amarok" "Amarok" >}},
{{< iref "media_players#audacious" "Audacious" >}} through the .cue plugin,
{{< iref "media_players#clementine" "Clementine" >}},
{{< iref "media_players#deadbeef" "DeaDBeef" >}},
{{< iref "media_players#cmus" "cmus" >}},

{{< iref "media_players#strawberry" "Strawberry" >}}
{{< iref "media_players#xmms2" "xmms2" >}} with the cue plugin, _and other, I have not
checked!_.

FLAC, Monkey's audio and Wavpack support embedded cuesheet by using a `CUESHEET` tag,
but the effective support depend on the player, some may even support the `CUESHEET` mp3
tag.

{{< iref "media_players#mpd" "mpd" >}} support cuesheets with an integrated parser which
works with both external and embedded cuesheets.

The command

    mpc load albumx/x.cue

loads the file `music_directory/albumx/x.cue` as playlist.

The cuesheet shoulf have the `FILE` value relative to the cueesheet
directory, usually the same directory where is placed the `.cue` file.
_It should not be relative to the music directory, as it is the case
for playlists._

In the case of an CUESHEET tag you can issue

    mpc load albumx/x.flac.


Few clients have cue sheet support, you can use cantata and ncmpcpp.


-   [cuetools](http://developer.berlios.de/projects/cuetools) is a set of
    utilities to manipulate cue files.

## Bookmarks
The following players have bookmarks: amarok, banshee, exaile thru plugin, quodlibet,
vlc.

Exaile has only one bookmark list, no export, no edit, clementine has none.

VlC has one active bookmark list that can be [saved and loaded with the playlist
](https://wiki.videolan.org/How_to_save_bookmarks).
You can edit the bookmark file from the play list, the
bookmark GUI interface allow only to add and delete them.

There is also a [VLC extension: Resume Media
](http://addons.videolan.org/content/show.php/Resume+Media+V3.40+%28Win%2BLin%29?content=165231)
that offer an extended bookmarking. _not tested_

VLC has also the possibility to play parts of media by using playlist
with the following structure:

    #EXTVLCOPT:start-time=28
    #EXTVLCOPT:stop-time=36
    video.mp4
    #EXTVLCOPT:start-time=500
    #EXTVLCOPT:stop-time=550
    video.mp4
    #EXTVLCOPT:start-time=900
    #EXTVLCOPT:stop-time=1100
    video2.mp4

All the previous bookmarking solutions are specific to a software piece and not
shareable, with an other media player.

## Chapters, Podcasts
The ogg format has a
[chapter extension ](https://wiki.xiph.org/Chapter_Extension)
wich record navigation points for a media file. They are used for
[enhanced podcasts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast#Enhanced_podcasts)
or
[podcasts novels or podcast audiobooks
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast#Podcast_novels)
The podcast is then called an {{< wp "Oggcast" >}}

See also _auphonic.com_ :
[Chapter Marks for MP3, MP4 Audio and Vorbis Comment (Enhanced Podcasts)
](https://auphonic.com/blog/2013/07/03/chapter-marks-and-enhanced-podcasts/)
and [Podcast Comparison, Part 3: Ogg Vorbis Metadata (Vorbis Comment)
](https://auphonic.com/blog/2012/01/22/podcast-comparison-part-3-ogg-vorbis-metadata-vorbis-comment/).

The first post contains example files to demonstrate chapters in MP4 (M4A), MP3, Ogg
Vorbis, Opus.


The ogg chapter extension is similar to the
[matroska chapter extension
](http://savvyadmin.com/adding-chapters-to-videos-using-mkv-containers/)
other metadata can be stored in
{{< wp "Vorbis comment" >}}.

A vorbis chapter is only a comment like:

    CHAPTER001=00:00:00.000
    CHAPTER001NAME=Chapter 1
    CHAPTER002=01:00:00.000
    CHAPTER002NAME=Chapter 2

They are recognized by vlc.
They are not used by exaile, smplayer, clementine.

On Android you can use the open source
[AntennaPod](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.danoeh.antennapod)
to display chapter marks with URLs in MP3 and Ogg Vorbis files.

See also [Podcast Client Feature Comparison Matrix
](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c2L14UVH1xtN4iDG4awheLbMgPCQgaKEamUauWs1gps/edit).
where it is said that neither amarok, banshee, gpodder, miro,
rythmnbox, hpodder (_obsolete_) support chapters; and gpodder is the
only one to support bookmarks. Most IOS clients have support for
chapters.
