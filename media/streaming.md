-   <a name="gstreamer"></a>[GStreamer (LGPL)](http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) is a
    streaming-media framework, based on graphs of filters which operate
    on media data. Applications using this library can do real-time
    sound processing and playing videos. New data types or processing
    capabilities can be added by installing new plugins.
    The Debian package _gstreamer-tools_ include the basic
    [command-line tools provided with GStreamer
    ](http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/manual/html/section-checklist-applications.html).

    the configure the default sink and source statically as well as allowing (or
    disallowing) clients to automatically start the server if not currently
    running.<br/> Spanning pulse with the session is disabled by putting `autospawn =
    no`.

    The client read `~/config/pulse/client.conf` and if it does not exists
    `/etc/pulse/client.conf`.  See {{< man "pulse-client.conf(5)" >}} for more
    information
-   [daemon.conf - daemon configuration

    defines base settings like the default sample rates used by modules, resampling
    methods, realtime scheduling ... . These can not be changed at runtime without
    restarting the PulseAudio daemon.  See the {{< man "pulse-daemon.conf" >}} for
    information.
-   To start manually pulseaudio to debug it, first disable _as above_ and stop the
    autospawned session then start again with `pulseaudio -v` to get info messages,
    `pulseaudio -vv` to also get debugging messages.

Sends the captured data from a source directly to a sink.

It uses an input and output stream so the source and sink can be moved in pavucontrol,
channel remixing is possible and the volume can be adjusted.

The module loopback and the command `pw-loopback` are
described in pipewire wiki [in the page Migrate-PulseAudio

# UPnP / DLNA

This section is about {{< wp "Universal Plug and Play" >}} UPnP which allows
device-to-device networking of appliances, I uses the TCP/IP, UDP and
HTTP protocols and supports zero configuration networking see the
{{< wp "Universal Plug and Play"  "wikipedia page for more info" >}}.

When talking of UPnP we should distinguish, the
{{< wp "Internet Gateway Device Protocol" >}} (IGD) which is a method of
automatically configuring port forwarding to allow {{< wp "NAT traversal" >}};
and broadcasting of digital media which is used by {{< wp "DLNA" >}} devices.

[Rygel](https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/Rygel)
is an UPnP AV MediaServer, It stick to a strict conformance to DNLA, and provide on the
fly conversion of media.

Media players may use Rygel to become a MediaRenderer through the Playbin plugin.  It
can then be controlled remotely by a UPnP or DLNA Controller.

_Rygel_ is in debian, the renderer plugin is in _rygel-playbin_, `rygel-gst-launch` is a
gst-launch plugin that enables using a a DLNA service/UPnP device in a gst pipeline; and
a configuration gui in _rygel-preferences_.

_rygel_, _rygel-playbin_, and severall plugins are in Debian.

Rygel with the playbin plugin takes on amd64 47M res / 17M shr on may 2018 for rygel
0.36.1, when playing a TV stream I got 56M / 26M.

## Hardware including an UPNP renderer

-   [List of MythTV UPnP clients
    ](https://www.mythtv.org/wiki/UPnP_Client_Info) both hardware and
    software.


## UpNP control point
A control point, functions as a digital audio/video remote control. Control points
automatically detect UPnP servers on the network to browse content directories and
request the transfer or streaming of media. A UPnP media renderer performs the actual
audio or video rendering. Control points and media renderers most commonly run on
separate devices, the control point being for example a tablet, and the renderer a
television or a networked audio computer connected to an audio receiver. Some control
points integrate a media renderer and may function as a complete music playing
application.


-   <a name="gupnp"></a>[GUPnP](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GUPnP)
    is a framework for creating UPnP devices and control points.  _GUPnP-Tools_ is a set

    Generic Control Point `gnupnp-universal-cp` an uploader `gupnp-upload` and a
    {{< wp "Simple Service Discovery Protocol" >}} (SSDP) commandline client.
    `gssdp-discover`. _GUPnP-Tools is in Debian._

    On amd64 _gupnp-av-cp_ takes 25 res / 17M shr on may 2018 for gupnp-tools 0.8.14.

-   [upplay](https://www.lesbonscomptes.com/upplay/) (GPL)
    is a desktop UPnP audio Control Point written in C++ for Linux/Unix and MS
    Windows. A _Debian_ package repository is provided. On amd64 upplay takes 53M res /
    35M shr on may 2018 for 1.2.11, which is very heavy for a control point.
