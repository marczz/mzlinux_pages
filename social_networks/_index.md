We include also in this section the collaborative software.

We try to categorize social networks in several sections:
-   Messenging applications are in {{< iref "xmpp" "xmpp"  >}},
-   {{< iref "irc" "IRC" >}} has its own page.
-   voice and video aimed applications are in the page {{< iref "sip" "SIP" >}}
-   {{< iref "microblogging" "Microblogging" >}} contains applications based on
    protocols like
    {< iref "social_networks#ostatus" "Ostatus" >}},
    {{< iref "social_networks#activitypub" "ActivityPub"  >}},
    {{< iref "social_networks#diaspora" "Diaspora" >}},
    {{< iref "social_networks#pumpio" "Pump.io" >}};

But there is no clean frontier, voice and video often include also a messaging ability,
microblogging also often include messaging...

{{< iref "p2p" "P2P" >}} is also used by some application and you find also a
{{< iref "p2p" "P2P Section" >}}.
