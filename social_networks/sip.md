# VoiP servers and proxys

-   {{< wp "FreeSWITCH" >}} is a  telephony platform that lie between
    a softphone and a PBX or a carrier-class softswitch.
    [FreeSwitch Wiki
    ](https://freeswitch.org/confluence/display/FREESWITCH/FreeSWITCH+Explained) and
-   {{< wp "OpenSER" >}} now named [Kamailio](http://www.kamailio.org/) (GPL)
    is a SIP proxy server, call router, and user agent registration
    server. It is a fork from __SER__ in 2004.
    [Kamailo has a Debian repository
    ](http://www.kamailio.org/wiki/packages/debs).
-   [OpenSIPS](http://www.opensips.org/) (GPL)
    is a fork from  OpenSER, it is also a SIP Registrar server,
    Location server, Proxy server and Redirect server; gateway to
    SMS/XMPP; .
-   [RTPProxy](http://www.rtpproxy.org) (GPL) is a relay
    for Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) media streams.
    It can work together with  SIP Express Router (SER),
    OpenSIPS,  Kamailio, Sippy B2BUA.
-   [Sippy B2BUA](https://github.com/sippy/b2bua) (GPL)
    is a RFC3261-compliant Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
    Back-to-back user agent (B2BUA) server software.  Unlike a SIP
    proxy server, which only maintains transaction state, the B2BUA
    maintains complete call state and participates in all call
    requests, so it can perform accurate call accounting, fail over
    call routing etc.  Unlike PBX-type solutions such as Asterisk for
    example, the B2BUA doesn't perform any media relaying or
    processing.
-   {{< wp "SIP Express Router" >}} (GPL) is a SIP server, SIP registrar,
    proxy or redirect server. It is packaged in Debian.
-   The [SIP Router Project](http://sip-router.org/)
    is the common development framework for SER and Kamailio.

## Asterisk
-   {{< wp "Asterisk" >}} is a complete PBX in software.
    Asterisk does voice over IP in four protocols, and can interoperate
    with almost all standards-based telephony equipment.
    Asterisk uses the {{< wp "Inter-Asterisk eXchange" >}} or __IAX2__ protocol.

    client which supports text, voice, video, file transfers, and a
    large inter-application communication nearly identical to pidgin
    but including SIP. It is written in C against gnome libraries, so

    (SIP/RTP/SRTP/ZRTP). _Jitsi_ supports
    {{< iref "#cusax" "CUSAX" >}} and has built-in
    IPv6, NAT traversal and DNSSEC.
    -   [Jitsi Home](https://jitsi.org/)
    -   [Jitsi Meet](https://jitsi.org/Projects/JitsiMeet) (apache
        License) is the VideoConferencing application of Jitsi. It is
        a WebRTC JavaScript applicationthe communication is Encrypted

        There is a [Docker container of Jitsi-Meet
        ](https://hub.docker.com/r/robertoandrade/jitsi-meet/).
-   [Linphone](http://www.linphone.org/) (GPL)
    is an audio and video GTK+ SIP client.  linphone takes 21M
    resident/15M shared; it is comparable with twinkle.  There is also
    a console client and an android platform build.  `linphonec` that
    uses only 7M resident/5M shared.
-   [Minisip](http://www.minisip.org/) (LGPL for the libraries, GPL
    for the application) User Agent running on Linux.
-   {{< wp "Pidgin_(software)"  "Pidgin" >}} (GPL)

    used instant messaging protocols _(but not yet SIP!)_. It is
    written in C, Python, Perl. See
    {{< iref "xmpp#pidgin" "Pidgin in my xmpp page" >}}.
-   {{< wp "Mumble" >}} (BSD License) is a voice chat application for groups.
    It is primarily intended for gaming.
-   [w:QuteCom](GPL) _[QuteCom Home](http://www.qutecom.org/)_
    previously _Wengophone_ is a sip client written in C++ with Qt
    lybraries, available on linux, windoze, and MacOs. It is packaged
    on Debian and Ubuntu.  It pretends to support also the xmms
    protocol and allows video-calls.  The front end is build with QT
    without extra KDE dependencies.<br /> The _meager_ documentation
    is in the [QuteCom Wiki](http://trac.qutecom.org/wiki).  Qutecom
    take 60M Resident/32 shr, 38M when disabling video, even before
    the first call, quite heavy compared to the 20M of twinkle.<br />
    Qutecom has kept from Wengophone some features that push you to
    connct with one provider, and make mainly landlines and mobile
    calls.<br /> The configuration interface is quite disappointing,
    you have to configure a main sip accounts, and add some alternates
    accounts for other protocols,wich are at a sub level of the main
    account. There is no way to enter a firewall traversing option, or
    simply set a stun server, but editing the advanced
    configuration. Very few is configurable even for sip, and still
    less for other protocols. I have been able to register on some of
    my accounts, but it refuses some others. And some of my jabber
    contacts, appears on-line, some others don't, even if they are
    online. So I renounced to use this version 2.2 from 2010.
-   [sflphone](http://www.sflphone.org/) (GPL) sip and IAX2  client for

# Proprietary protocols
I just give a pointer to most popular VoIP solutions. We should prefer
open source.

-   {{< wp "Skype" >}} or [Skype Home Page](http://www.skype.com/)
    P2P telephony and videoconferences is a closed proprietary
    protocol,
    There are [numerous reasons to prefer an open source protocol
    ](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SkypeEthics)
    considered only the  {{< wp "Skype#Privacy"  "Skype lack of privacy" >}}
    and its use for censorship. Morever skype pretend to have
    encryption but {{< wp "Skype#Security_and_privacy"  "is not secure" >}} and it
    {{< wp "Global_surveillance_disclosures_(2013–present)"  "has been shown" >}}
    that that agencies such as the NSA and the FBI have
    the ability to eavesdrop on Skype.
    <br />
    But we can be pushed to use it to communicate
    with skype addicts, _at least until they give up their addiction_,
