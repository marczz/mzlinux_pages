For the web interface android browsers you cannot use drag & drop, but
the file loader allow _docs_ as intent that allow to choose either the

but that works also.

    written to the disk using symmetric encryption. The encryption key is either part
    of the download URL, or specified by the uploader. More details in the

-   [FileTea](https://github.com/elima/FileTea) (AGPL)
    functions as a web server. Users can drag files into their web
    browser and a URL will be generated for each one. Those URLs can
    be sent to other people, who will be able to start downloading the
    files immediately.

    An HTML5 capable browser is required in order to share the files, but
    any HTTP client can download them, including command-line tools such
    as curl or wget.

    Files are sent through the server, but no data is stored there:
    FileTea is only used to route the traffic. This also means that
    there's no limit to the size of shared files.

    The service is anonymous and does not require user registration.

    _Filetea is not updated since january 2014. It is still in Debian_

-   [FileZ](https://github.com/FileZ/FileZ) (GPL)

    and stored on the server. All the encryption/decryption processes take place in your
    browser. The encryption key is never sent over the network. You can host Lufi on

    -   [Lufi Wiki](https://framagit.org/luc/lufi/wikis/home).
    -   [Lufi Cli](https://framagit.org/luc/lufi-cli)

        quite quickly, so I don't give a list but you can see some european instances at

-   [Plik](https://github.com/root-gg/plik/tree/master) (MIT License)

     backend Files, OpenStack Swift, or S3 this last allow server side encryption; and

-   <a name="sharik"></a>[Sharik](https://github.com/marchellodev/sharik) ( MIT License)
    is a golang cross-platform solution for sharing files via Wi-Fi or Mobile Hotspot.
    it is available for Android, Windows, Linux, iOS. Sharik provides an HTTP server
    allowing to download the file you want to share, so the client can download without
    installing a specific client.
    -  There is also a go cli-only version
       [sharic](https://github.com/marchellodev/sharic).

    _Sharik_ serve the files on HTTP on the localhost, neither the protocol, nor the
    files are encrypted. So it is only acceptable if the local network is on a firewall
    protected lan. When connected to an hotspot, we should not send private files. For
    mobile to mobile transmission we can also use a wifi connection sharing protected by
    password, giving some protection against _naive_ intruder, the main benefit here is
    that don't require a wifi internet connection and it does not count against your
    data plan.

    So Sharik is good for _quick and dirty_ file exchange, all the protected file
    storages servers of this section offer a more secure solution, at the price of
    needing a relay, and an internet connection.
-   [weborf](https://github.com/ltworf/weborf) (GPL-3.0)
    is a python instant server to share files using the HTTP protocol. It provides CLI
    and It comes with a Python/QT5 GUI called _qweborf_, allows using webdav, can
    compress directories on the fly.  The server has CGI and (x)inetd support, and
    systemd integration. It can do NAT traversal to share files outside of the local
    network.

    Weborf can
    [cache the server generated contents](https://ltworf.github.io/weborf/cache.html)
    With the expense of a small amount of disk space, this can greatly increase the
    speed.

    [_weborf_, _weborf-daemon_ and  _qweborf_ are in Debian
    ](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/weborf)..
-   [Zendto](https://zend.to/) (Open source _Unknown licence_)

There are many similar services that we name with the common name {{< wp "Pastebin" >}}
from the first {{< wp "pastebin.com" >}} they allow a free web clip by pasting some
text, and they give you an url to retrieve the text.

Some pastebin have unclear license, and no source
available, so it is difficult to know if your data and metadata is monitored. If you
have to store sensible data you should use a {{< iref "#crypted_bin" "Crypted Bin" >}}.


You can use to create you post a web page and most sites have a REST HTTP Api that allow
to create posts with a script. _I list only the sites offering an API, and not too much
adds, and the FOSS software_.

They can offer optional features like expiration dates, private posts, syntax
highlighting,
