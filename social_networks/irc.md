## Emacs irc client {#emacs_irc}
There are sveral emacs iRC clients _under  GPL License_.

-   [Emacswiki: InternetRelayChat](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InternetRelayChat)
    give a list of clients and IRC references
-   [Circe](https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/circe/wiki).
-   [EmacsIRCClient
    ](http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/EmacsIRCClient)
    aka ERC.,
    [IrChat](http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/IrChat),
-   [LieceIrcClient
    ](http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/LieceIrcClient),
-   [rcirc](http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/rcirc),
-   [RieceIrcClient
    ](http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/RieceIrcClient),
-   [weechat.el (Emacs)](https://github.com/the-kenny/weechat.el) is a client for the
    {{< iref "#weechat_relay" "WeeChat protocol" >}}.
-   [ZenIRC](http://www.zenirc.org/) (
    [ZenIRC emacswiki links](http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/ZenIRC)).

It is uneasy to compare the size of these client to other clients, if you have to launch
emacs only to chat, it cost you 18M, it is my mean emacs size, that is 13M bare size +
5M packages. But if you have always an emacs running from the beginning of your session
to the end, as I use to do on my main desktop, it costs you virtually nothing (circe is
tiny and loading it is not perceptible when looking at res. mem. size).

## Weechat {#Weechat}
[WeeChat](http://www.weechat.org/) (GPL)
is an irc ncurses client, extensible by C plugins or script language (Perl, Python,
Ruby, guile, Lua, Tcl, javascript, php).

It uses ncurses an take 6M to 13M/6M cached of Resident size _depending of loaded
plugins_. WeeChat lack of an easy menu from the client, so to use it you have to be (or
get) accustomed with IRC commands. But Weechat helps you by providing an extensive help.

Debian has a weechat-curse, and a weechat-headless client, and packages for plugins, and
for the support of programming/script languages: tcl, guile, lua, php, python, ruby.

Weechat is a very active project which has a long development history. It is born
in 2003.  WeeChat 0.3.x (september 2009) was a major update new plugin api, new plugins,
