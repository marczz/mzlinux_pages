## different types of QRcodes:
-   [Model 1 and 2](https://www.qrcode.com/en/codes/model12.html),
-   [Micro QR Code](https://www.qrcode.com/en/codes/microqr.html) that can encode up to 35
    numerals,
-   [rMQR Code](https://www.qrcode.com/en/codes/rmqr.html) of rectangular shape that can
    store up to 361 numerals,

-   [SQRC](https://www.denso-wave.com/en/system/qr/product/sqrc.html) which contains both

    with an image.

    The two last codes type are proprietaries.

## QR Code capacity
[Information capacity and versions of QR Code | QRcode.com](https://www.qrcode.com/en/about/version.html) list  capacities of QR Codes
depending of version, error-correcting code, and type of information.

From the previous document we get

For the larger `v40`, `177x177` bits bitmap

| ECC | loss | Data bits | Numeric | Alphanum. | Binary |
|-----|------|-----------|---------|-----------|--------|
| L   | 7%   | 23,648    | 7,089   | 4,296     | 2,953  |
| M   | 15%  | 18,672    | 5,596   | 3,391     | 2,331  |
| Q   | 25%  | 13,328    | 3,993   | 2,420     | 1,663  |
| H   | 30%  | 10,208    | 3,057   | 1,852     | 1,273  |

If we want smaller image, the capacity of course drop down proportionally to the square
of the size of the image square, to achieve the third of
capacity of `v40` we get the `v22` `105x105` bitmap

| ECC | loss | Data bits | Numeric | Alphanum. | Binary |
|-----|------|-----------|---------|-----------|--------|
| L   | 7%   | 8,048     | 2,409   | 1,460     | 1,003  |
| M   | 15%  | 6,256     | 1,872   | 1,134     | 779    |
| Q   | 25%  | 4,544     | 1,358   | 823       | 565    |
| H   | 30%  | 3,536     | 1,056   | 640       | 439    |

The full table of capacity for each version is available in
[qrcode.com - information capacity and versions
](https://www.qrcode.com/en/about/version.html).

The Rectangular Micro QR code has a lesser capacity than model2 QR code, but a bigger
capacity than Micro QR Code.

It may be not appropriate to transmit big data chunk like a detailed vcard *the example
at the end of the page is 397 chars long too big to fit in the larger rMQR*, but for
most use like id string, url, sms, mailto, it can be convenient.

For the larger v32 R17x139 we get:

| ECC | loss | Data bits | Numeric | Alphanum. | Binary |
|-----|------|-----------|---------|-----------|--------|
| M   | 15%  | 1216      | 361     | 219       | 150    |
| H   | 30%  | 608       | 178     | 108       | 174    |

If we want a thinner rectangle v10 R9x139 we have

| ECC | loss | Data bits | Numeric | Alphanum. | Binary |
|-----|------|-----------|---------|-----------|--------|
| M   | 15%  | 504       | 147     | 89        | 68     |
| H   | 30%  | 264       | 75      | 46        | 31     |

With the narrowest square v5 R7x139
| ECC | loss | Data bits | Numeric | Alphanum. | Binary |
|-----|------|-----------|---------|-----------|--------|
| M   | 15%  | 352       | 102     | 62        | 42     |
| H   | 30%  | 192       | 54      | 33        | 22     |

This is only some example with the longer rectangle of 139 modules for a complete table
look at the [qrcode.com rMQR page](https://www.qrcode.com/en/codes/rmqr.html).

Note that to hold an the same payload than R17x139 we have to use a QR code of 49x49,
for R9x139 the equivalent is 33x33, and for R7x139 a QR code of 29x29.

The density of information is similar, but we can use a narrow zone.

        -   specify minimum and maximum version numbers allowed, then library will
            automatically choose smallest version in the range that fits the data.
        -   specify mask pattern manually, or let the library choose the optimal one;
        -   specify absolute error correction level, or the library use the high est that
            does not increase the version number

# Barcode/QRcode online services
-   [QR Code Generator - Thonky.com](https://www.thonky.com/qrcode/) let you choose the
    error correction level, the mask pattern, and the version *i.e. the size*.
-   [QR code generator library live demo
    ](https://www.nayuki.io/page/qr-code-generator-library#live-demo-javascript)
    allows also to choose EEC, mask pattern, version, border modules, pixel by modules.
    The QR code can be generated as bitmap or SVG.
-   [Qr and rMQR Generator](https://qrqrpardemo.nakanishi.dev/) powered by
    {{< iref "#qrqrpar" "qrqrpar" >}} generate rMQR, micro QR, type 2 QR with a choice
    of color, privileging area, height or width, with round or square shape, choosing
    the margin and pixmap size.
-   [Aspose online code reader and scanner](https://products.aspose.app/barcode/)
    can [generate](https://products.aspose.app/barcode/generate) all type of barcodes,
    QR codes, micro QR codes, rMQR ... in bitmap and svg; the available parameters are
    minimal, you can choose the the size of the image but not the version or module
    number.

    The application can also [recognize](https://products.aspose.app/barcode/recognize)
    any bardode or QRcode, microQR, rMQR image; or
    [scan](https://products.aspose.app/barcode/scanqr) it with your camera.

    An android application *Aspose.BarCode Scan & Create* is also available, but do not
    recognize or scan rMQR codes.

    All the code is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/aspose-barcode-cloud/) and
    available under a MIT License.
-   [Oudon Online rMQR Generator](https://rmqr.oudon.xyz/) powered by rmqrcode-python.
    You can choose ECC and maximize size or height.
-   [Tec-It Online BarcodeGenerator](http://barcode.tec-it.com/)
    allows to create among a huge choice of barcode symbologies, or QR codes and
    microQR codes, *no rMQR*. You can not select the version or other parameter of QR
    codes.
-   [QR Code Generator](https://www.qr-code-generator.com/) generate QR code for
    URL, vCard, Text, E-mail, SMS, Wifi, Twitter, Facebook, PDF, MP3, App Stores,
    Images. There is no possibility of tailoring the QR Code version, modules, mask. You
    can only add a frame. No support for other QR Code than classic Type 2.
-   [QRCode Monkey](https://www.qrcode-monkey.com/) a large choice of helpers to
    generate the embedded text. For the QR code a large choice of cosmetics, but no
    choice of version, modules, margin, nor alternative QRCode type. Downloads in bitmap
    or SVG.
-   [QRStuff QR Code Generator](https://www.qrstuff.com/) yet an other online QR code
    generator, seems containing more advertisements.

# Mobile Barcode readers
There are many barcode readers on android and ios, the support for different symbologies
is an important criteria, an other mandatory feature is that the barcode reader don't
launch blindly an application, but let you approve the barcode text before opening the
app.
Other wise you cannot avoid that it launch an expensive phone call or sms or use any of
your app to do an unexpected operation.

For reading rMQR there are only few application the best support seems to be the Denso
Wave application [QRQR](https://www.denso-wave.com/en/system/qr/product/reader.html),
which is available on Android and IOS.
