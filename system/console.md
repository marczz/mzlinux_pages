# Console message log

The Linux kernel log levels are integers from 0 to 7.

| level | name         |
|-------|--------------|
| 0     | KERN_EMERG   |
| 1     | KERN_ALERT   |
| 2     | KERN_CRIT    |
| 3     | KERN_ERR     |
| 4     | KERN_WARNING |
| 5     | KERN_NOTICE  |
| 6     | KERN_INFO    |
| 7     | KERN_DEBUG   |

You can know the loglevel with
~~~
$ cat /proc/sys/kernel/printk
4	4	1	7
~~~

or
~~~
$ sysctl kernel.printk
kernel.printk = 4	4	1	7
~~~

The four numbers are values of _console_loglevel_, _default_message_loglevel_,
_minimum_console_loglevel_, _default_console_loglevel_.

In the previous example the current level is _KERN_WARNING_ meaning that only messages
with a severity of at least _warning_ are written to the console.

You can change the console level until newt boot with:
~~~
# echo "3" > /proc/sys/kernel/printk
~~~
or
~~~
# sysctl -w kernel.printk=3
~~~

The the magic SysRq key is a key combo you can hit which the kernel will respond to
regardless of whatever else it is doing, unless it is completely locked up.

You send it by pressing `ALT-SysRq-<command key>`, or `ALT-SysRq` followed by
`ALT-<command key>`.

# Setting console Keyboard and Font {#console_setup}
See also {{< iref "input_methods" "input method" >}},

-   The keyboard and font are set at startup with {{< man "setupcon(1)" >}} from the package
    console-setup.
-   {{< man "setupcon(1)" >}} default is to read the keyboard configuration from
    `/etc/default/keyboard` which can be overrided by `~/.keyboard`. The syntax of these
    files is given in {{< man "keyboard(5)" >}}.
-   {{< man "setupcon(1)" >}} read the font configuration from `/etc/default/console-setup`
    overrided by ` ~/.console-setup` whose syntax is given in
    {{< man "console-setup(5)" >}}.
-   You can change `/etc/default/keyboard` by editing it or by running:

        # dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration

    to activate the new setting run

        # systemctl restart keyboard-setup

    But if you only want to temporarily change the console keyboard run

        $ setupcon VARIANT

    which read the configuration `/etc/default/keyboard.VARIANT`.

-   The pkg `kbd` requires either the older `console-data` or the more recent
    `console-setup`.

    The `console-data` load keymaps in `/usr/share/keymaps` with `loadkeys`.
    So there are a distinct description of the keymaps for X and for the console.

    The package `console-setup` on the other hand, use {{< man "setupcon(1)" >}}
    which call {{< man "ckbcomp(1)" >}}to compile the xkb description
    in a temporary console keymap which is loaded by {{< man "loadkeys(1)" >}}.
    No separate console keymap is necessary.

-   The same file `/etc/default/keyboard` is also used by Xorg and Wayland to set the
    keyboard.
-   Debian Wiki explains [How to set keyboard layout in initramfs
    ](https://wiki.debian.org/Keyboard#How_to_set_keyboard_layout_in_initramfs),
    and _How to enable USB keyboard in initramfs_.
-   A lower level utility to manipulate {{< man "keymaps(5)" >}} is
    {{< man "loadkeys(1)" >}}.
-   A lower level utility to manipulate console fonts is {{< man "setfont(8)" >}}
-   The locale is seen by running {{< man "locale" >}} without arguments.
    The default are set in `/etc/default/locale` and can be changed by editing this file
    or running {{< man "update-locale(8)" >}}.
-   You can see all locales by running `locale -a`, the available locale are configured
    in `/etc/locale.gen` and can have to be regenerated with {{< man "locale-gen" >}}
    when you change this file.

## Lower level Utilities

{{< man "showkey" >}}
:   prints to standard output either the scan codes (`-s`) or the
    keycode (`-k`) or the ascii code(`-a`) of each key pressed.
    _It can be used only on console._

{{< man "loadkeys" >}}
:   load a kernel keymap for the console.

{{< man "dumpkeys" >}}
:   writes the current contents of the keyboard drivers translation
    tables

{{< man "unicode\_start" >}}
:   Enables Unicode processing in the current console.

-   first reload the keys in unicode to produce UTF-8 encoded
    multibyte sequences, instead of single bytes >= 0x80 by
    `dumpkeys | loadkeys --unicode`
-   Tell the console output driver that the bytes arriving are
    UTF-8 encoded multibyte sequences by
    `echo -n -e               '\033%G'`
-   set the font to `$1` and optionally the map to `$2`

# kmscon {#kmscon}
Kmscon is a simple terminal emulator based on linux kernel mode setting (KMS)
_but KMS is not required for Kmscon_.
It replaces the in-kernel VT implementation with a userspace
console.

It does not depend on any graphics-server, like X.org, but instead
provides a raw console layer that can be used independently.

Kmscon provides  full-internationalized keyboard handling, full UTF8
input/font support, hardware-accelerated rendering, multi-seat support
and more.

Kmscon can also run in listen-mode and replace virtual terminals. This
allows to run multiple graphics-servers (like kmscon,  X-Server,
{{< iref "xorg#wayland" "Wayland Compositors" >}}
simultaneously on all seats.

-   _kmscon- is build upon [libstm](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/libtsm/)
    _Terminal-emulator State Machine_ This library is very similar to libvte but without
    GTK+ bindings, it allows mainly to interpret terminal escape sequences in a Xterm
    compatible way.

# Framebuffer terminals {#framebuffer_terminals}

-   [fbterm](http://code.google.com/p/fbterm/ )(Frame buffer terminal emulator),
    is a replacement of Linux console terminal that can function outside
    of Xorg. The development has stopped _there is still a Debian package_.
    It uses X libraries to handle TTF fonts.
    -   [Archwiki: Fbterm](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Fbterm)


-   [fbpad (git)](http://repo.or.cz/w/fbpad.git),
    is a small framebuffer terminal that manages many terminals through single character
    tags. It is exceptionally lightweight, written in C and using its own font format,
    tinyfont, which avoids xorg font dependencies. fbpad optionally supports 256 colors,
    bold fonts, and saving the framebuffer contents to memory.
    -   [ArchWiki: fbpad](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Fbpad)
    -   _fbpad_ use fonts in a special _tinyfont_ format.
        The two programs *mkfn_ft* and *mkfn_stb* from the
        [fbpad_mkfn](https://repo.or.cz/fbpad_mkfn.git) repository convert ttf or stb
        truetype to The font format for fbpad _tinyfonts_.

-   [yaft](https://github.com/uobikiemukot/yaft)
    is simple framebuffer terminal emulator.  yaft supports UTF8 and UCS2 glyphs
    including wide character and 256 color. It hs its own format of fonts, that are
    created by translating BDF fonts with the provided utility *mkfont_bdf*

-   The [nosh package](https://jdebp.eu/Softwares/nosh/) is a suite of
    system-level utilities for initializing and running a BSD or Linux system, for managing
    daemons, for managing terminals, and for managing logging. All the nosh software is
    also available as Debian packages.

    [User-space virtual terminals
    ](https://jdebp.eu/Softwares/nosh/user-vt-screenshots.html)
    are one of the terminal management features of the nosh package.

    [console-terminal-emulator
    ](https://jdebp.eu/Softwares/nosh/guide/commands/console-terminal-emulator.xml)
    a userspace virtual terminal aimed at replicating Linux and FreeBSD/PC-BSD kernel
    virtual terminals.

    For more info look at the [nosh Guide](https://jdebp.eu/Softwares/nosh/guide/).

-  [Bogl Bterm](https://packages.debian.org/sid/bogl-bterm)
   an a UTF-enabled framebuffer terminal, part of Ben's Own Graphics Library, a small
   framebuffer library including basic widgets, support for text in multiple languages,
   and mouse handling. It uses its own bgf font format from fonts created with the
   _bdftobogl_ utility.
