# KVM _Kernel-based Virtual Machine_ {#KVM}
-   [KVM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel-based_Virtual_Machine) (some part GPL,
    some part LGPL) is a virtualization solution for Linux on x86 hardware containing
    virtualization extensions (Intel VT or AMD-V). It consists of a loadable kernel
    module, _kvm.ko_, and a processor specific module, _kvm-intel.ko_ or _kvm-amd.ko_
    providing {{< wp "Hardware-assisted virtualization (HVM)" >}} used to run
    {{< iref "#qemu" "QEMU" >}} _Unlike native Qemu that uses emulation_. The kernel
    component of KVM is included in mainline Linux.

    Using KVM, one can run multiple virtual machines running unmodified
    Linux or Windows images. Each virtual machine has private
    virtualized hardware: a network card, disk, graphics adapter, etc.

    KVM is the default virtualization technology in Ubuntu.

    The difference with {{< iref "#xen" "Xen" >}} is [explained in the KVM FAQ
    ](http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/FAQ#General_KVM_information). Xen is an external
    hypervisor that divides resources among guests, and can run on non-hvm x86
    processors using {{< wp "paravirtualization" >}}; On the other hand, KVM uses the
    regular Linux scheduler and memory management; it is much smaller
    and simpler and featureful. But _KVM_  does not support paravirtualization which
    limit it's use to hvm x86 processors.

    KVM can be managed via {{< iref "#libvirt" "libvirt" >}} using _virsh_ as described
    in [KVM/Virsh - Ubuntu Community Wiki](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KVM/Virsh).

    It works by running Windows under KVM and communicating through a RDP server.

# LXC {#LXC}

{{< wp "LXC" "Linux container tools (LXC)" >}} is a virtualization method for running
multiple isolated server on a single control host. It provides a virtual environment
that has its own process and network space.  Lxc is similar to a chroot, but with much
more isolation.  Early versions of Docker used LXC as the container execution driver,
but LXC support was dropped in Docker v1.10.

# Qemu {#qemu}
[Qemu](http://wiki.qemu.org/) (GPL)is a generic  emulator and virtualizer.

As an emulator, QEMU can run guest OSes on an architecture different from the host.

When guest and host architecture is identical QEMU can be used as virtualizer and
achieve near native performances by executing the guest code directly on the host
CPU. When using {{< iref "#KVM" "KVM" >}}, QEMU can virtualize x86, server and embedded
PowerPC, and S390 guests.

    system, that runs on Windows, Linux and Macintosh hosts and
    supports as guests Windows,
    DOS/Windows 3.x, Linux, and OpenBSD. Packaged
    binaries are available for the main distributions.**VirtualBox**
    was initially developped by *Innotek* which was acquired by Sun
    Microsystems in February 2008 (release 1.6 and 2.0 of VirtualBox).

    -   Working syslog, which can either export all logs to Dockerâ€™s logging
        infrastructure, or keep them within the container,
    -   Working real schedulers (cron, anacron, and at) and logrotate.

    and optional features:

    -   SSH client and server (optionally exposed to the Internet).
    -   Automatic security patching via unattended-upgrades and needsrestart.
