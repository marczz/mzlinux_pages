    devices appear as locally attached devices. Most storage networks
    use the SCSI protocol for communication between servers and disk
    drive devices. They use technology such:

-   [Nfs Ganesha](https://github.com/nfs-ganesha/nfs-ganesha/wiki) (LGPL)
    is a user-mode file server for NFS (v3, 4.0, 4.1, 4.1 pNFS, 4.2).
    It is in Debian.

-   {{< man "exports(5)" >}} references the exports
    option used by the server nfs daemon.
  - We can use
    {{< man "showmount(8)" >}} to examine exports of a
    server

           showmount [-adehv] [--all] [--directories] [--exports]\
               [--no-headers] [--help] [--version] [host]

-   You should run the command `exportfs -ra to` force nfsd to
    re-read the /etc/exports file
    ({{< man "exportfs(8)" >}})
    If you can't find the exportfs command, then you can kill nfsd with
    the `-HUP` flag
-   `hard,intr` is recommended on all fs, it means the program
    accessing a file on NFS will hang when the server crashes and when
    the NFS server is back online the program will continue undisturbed
    from where it was. But because of intr you can kill the program.
-   I did some benchmark for access of a nfsv3 server from my linksys
    router to evaluate the effects of buffer size:
    -   performance with default buffers or 32k buffer is 1.7 MBytes/s
        = 14 Mbits/s write, read is twice quicker i.e 3,4MBytes/s = 28
        Mbits/s
    -   with 16k buffer it lower down to 12Mbits/s write, 19Mbits/s
        read
    -   with 8k buffer 10Mbits/s write, 15Mbits/s read


To forward nfs v3 through NAT is not trivial because the number of
services used and the use of portmapped ports. To view the ports
used on some machine you can use
{{< man "rpcinfo(8)" >}} it can be necessary to
secure your firewall rules to tie down the ports of the nfs
services to fixed values.

The following table gives the services and ports used for nfs


<table width="700"  cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" border="1" align="left" summary="table of nfs services ports">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>service </th>

        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<br/>

On gentoo system you can give the ports in `/etc/conf.d/nfs` the
debian/ubuntu user will use `/etc/default/nfs-common` and
`/etc/default/nfs-kernel-server`

The nfsv4 allow tcp connection and don't use rpc so crossing firewall
is easier.

-   [smbclient](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/smbclient.1.html)
    is a ftp-like samba client from the samba distribution,
-   [Samba Commander (SMBC)](http://sourceforge.net/projects/smbc/) (GPL)
    is a text mode SMB network commander that allows to browse the local network,
    search for files, download/upload files and directories and create them both
    locally and remotely. The last release is in 2005 and it is no longer packaged in
    Debian.
-   [SMBNetFS](http://sourceforge.net/projects/smbnetfs/)
    (GPL) is a fuse filesystem that allows you to use samba/microsoft
    network in the same manner as the network eighbourhood in
    Windoze. It is in Debian.
    -   [ArchWiki: samba - smbnetfs
        ](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/samba#smbnetfs)

-   [Fusesmb](http://www.ricardis.tudelft.nl/~vincent/fusesmb/) is an
    older implementation of samba under fuse that allows you to create
    a folder that displays the available shares on a network. SMBNetFS
    and Fusesmb uses the same library _libsmbclient_ _gvfs_ has also a
    backend for Samba. It is in Debian.

    [FuseSmb - Ubuntu Help](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FuseSmb)
    warns that:
    >> Note that "fusesmb" has several outstanding bug reports from people who find that
    >> it leaves an empty directory with no contents, and that its "fusesmb.cache" file
    >> never gets written.


## Samba tips

-   The most basic way to test your installation is with
    [smbclient
    ](http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/manpages-3/smbclient.1.html)
-   The configuration directories mentioned in all man pages and particularly in
    [smb.conf(5)
    ](http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/manpages-3/smb.conf.5.html)
    is seen with the command [smbd
    ](http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/manpages-3/smbd.8.html):

        smbd -b

-   The stored accounts are listed by root with the
    [pdbedit utility
    ](http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/manpages-3/pdbedit.8.html)
    as `pdbedit --list`, the details of an account is seen with

        pdbedit --verbose --list <account>

-   The [pdbedit utility
    ](http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/manpages-3/pdbedit.8.html)
    can also be used to add or delete accounts, see the
    [pdbedit(8) man page
    ](http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/manpages-3/pdbedit.8.html)
    or [Samba HowTo: account databases
    ](http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/Samba-HOWTO-Collection/passdb.html)
-   The master browser is returned by
     [nmblookup](http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/manpages-3/nmblookup.1.html):

        nmblookup -M -- -

-   To do a unicast query to some host use something like:

        nmblookup -U 192.168.1.1 -R 'WORKGROUP#1E'

-    A Reverse query is done with:

        nmblookup  -A 192.168.1.2

-   You can also use the program [NBTScan
    ](http://inetcat.org/software/nbtscan.html)
    to do a network scanning using it as:

        sudo nbtscan -r 192.168.1.0/24

## GFS2 {#gfs2}
{{< wp "Global File System 2" >}} (GFS2)  (GPL)
is a  is a {{< wp "shared-disk file system" >}} available for Linux computer
clusters. It requires all nodes to have direct concurrent access to
the same shared block storage and has no disconnected operating
mode like other {{< wp "shared-disk file systems" >}} like {{< wp "OCFS2" >}}, {{< wp "Lustre" >}},
{{< wp "Lizardfs" >}}.

In contrast  {{< wp "distributed file systems" >}} like GlusterFS, Ceph, BeeGFS  do not share
block level access to the same storage but use a network protocol
and can have a disconnected operating mode.
It uses Fibre Channel, iSCSI, AoE or DRDB in primary/primary mode devices as
storage.

_Not to be confused with {{< wp "Google File System" >}} a proprietary distributed
fs also known by the acronym GFS or GoogleFS._

## NBD {#nbd}
{{< wp "Network_block_device"  "NBD (Network block device)" >}}
([nbd home](http://nbd.sourceforge.net/) )
kernel module, allows remote servers to be used as local block
devices

## Tahoe-LAFS
{{< wp "Tahoe-LAFS" >}}
_the Least Authority File System_ is a distributed filesystem
written in python over Fuse, that features high reliability,
strong security properties, and a fine-grained sharing model.
Files are encrypted, signed, erasure-coded, then distributed over
multiple servers, such that any (configurable) subset of the
servers will be sufficient to recover the data.

There is a Tahoe-LAFS Debian Package.

# Cluster Management

## Heartbeat and Pacemaker
__Heartbeat__ i.e. {{< wp "Linux-HA" >}} is  a high-availability clustering
solution for Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris and Mac OS X.

[Pacemaker](http://clusterlabs.org/pacemaker/) (GPL)
is an open source high availability resource manager.
