# Console File managers {#console}
-   The ancestor of Ncurses file managers is
    [Thomas E. Dickey's ded](http://dickey.his.com/ded/ded.html) now
    superseded by Midnight Commander. The ded design dates from 1988,
    but there is still available build and even deb packages on the
    home page.
-   The {{< wp "Midnight Commander" >}} (GPL) is a console application written with
    Ncurses (or S-Lang) it is an old application still actively maintained in 2020.

# Graphical file managers

-   Wikipedia: {{< wp "File manager" >}}, [Comparison of file managers].
-   [ArchWiki: File manager functionality
    ](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/File_manager_functionality)

-   <a name="pcmanfm"></a>[PCManFM](https://wiki.lxde.org/en/PCManFM)
    is a
    light GTK-2 file manager, it is comparable to Thunar, but have
    lower requirements, and you may prefer it if you don't have xfce.
    _PCManFM_  is part of {{< iref "desktop#lxde" "lxde" >}}
    -   _pcmanfm_ memory footprint is 14M Resident/ 10M shr for an empty
        directory but it will grow when opening directories with many
        files (and bitmaps thumbnails) and as so many applications;
        it does not garbage collect when closing.
    -   _pcmanfm_ can be used as a desktop manager daemon with the options
        `--desktop -d`, it then uses 11M resident/8.5 shared
        _before opening any folder_.

    <a name="pcmanfm-qt"></a>{{< iref "desktop#lxqt" "lxqt" >}} replaces the GTK-2 version
    by [lxqt/pcmanfm-qt](https://github.com/lxqt/pcmanfm-qt) (GPL)
    a Qt port of PCManFM and libfm. PCManFM-QT is wayland compatible as it is based on
    QT-5.

    PCManFM can also be built with GTK3, this build is used in arch-linux package
    _pcmanfm-gtk3_ and in the Nix package.

    -   Wikipedia: {{< wp "PCMan File Manager" >}}.
    -   [Archlinux: PCManFM](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PCManFM)
        contains a usefull section on [Volume handling
        ](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PCManFM#Volume_handling),
        that can be done either with _udisks/udisks2_  or _gvfs_.
    -   [Gentoo Wiki: PCManFM](http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/PCManFM).
-   [SpaceFM](http://ignorantguru.github.io/spacefm/) (GPL)
    is a fork of PCManFM 0.5 that has been competing with pcmanfm for
    years, but now since march 2015 it had only a minimal maintenance, and the last
    commit is in 2018.
    The fork of PCManFM 0.5 was did by developers that did not want the gvfs
    bindings that were added to PCManFM, and rather preferred
    the [udevil](http://ignorantguru.github.io/udevil/)
    <a name="udevil"></a> mount program.
    SpaceFM can use udevil, pmount or udisks/udisks2, and if PCManFM
    has kept gvfs, it is no longer mandatory and can be replaced by
    udisks/udisks2.<br />
    The memory footprints of the two products is similar and they have
    the same functionality of a tabbed File Manager and Desktop
    manager.<br />
    What distinguish SpaceFM is the extended configurations options
    including an easy system of plugins, allowing easy shell plugins.

        <a name="udevil"></a>
        is a command line Linux program which mounts and unmounts
        removable devices without a password, shows device info, and
        monitors device changes. It can also mount ISO files, nfs://,
        smb://, ftp://, ssh:// and WebDAV URLs, and tmpfs/ramfs
        filesystems.<br /> it includes a mounting daemon
        _devmon_. _udevil_ has no dependency on udisks, gvfs, fuse,
        policykit, consolekit, etc.<br />
        _udevil_ takes 1.5M resident / 1.2M shared; devmon add 1.9M
        resident / 1.3M shared.

-   {{< wp "Thunar" >}} (GPL) the [xfce](http://xfce.org/) window manager.
    -    [Thunar Home](http://docs.xfce.org/xfce/thunar/start)
    -    Thunar project was publishing  a
         _memory usage page_ (unavailable today?)
         where there is a comparison between Konqueror, ROX, Nautilus and
         Thunar memory footprints. They advocate that the data size of
         thunar is only 3M which is roughly the overhead of the application.
         It is also what I experience, when I launch Thunar I get an
         Overhead of 3M. Note also that the amount of unshared memory is
         of course what is meaningfull in these comparisons, but this
         unshared memory is **not** the difference between resident and
         shared memory, because what is named _shared_ is what is potentially
         shared, to add a single Qt application on a gtk desktop is costly
         even if most libraries are potentially shared.
-   [gentoo file manager](http://www.obsession.se/gentoo/)
    Is a GTK3 2 panels, commander like, file manager, it is not
    related to the Gentoo Linux distribution. Gentoo uses the
    {{< wp "GIO_(GNOME)"  "GIO" >}} library. _Gentoo_ uses 18M resident / 12M shared.
-   [emelfm2](http://emelfm2.net/) is a two panels,
    Norton commander (or Midnight commander)
    like file manager for  Gtk3. Emlfm2 uses 16M resident memory / 12M shared.
    Emelfm2 is no longer available in main Debian,but is still under
    active development in 2014. It is [proposed in Ubuntu
    ](http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=emelfm),
    you can also find the latest
    deb package on [emlfm2 PPA](https://launchpad.net/~emelfm2).

-   If you install kde you can do nothing but using the heavy
    [Konqueror](http://konqueror.kde.org/)
-   A Gnome user can not avoid
    [Nautilus](https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Apps/Nautilus)
    now renamed {{< wp "GNOME Files" >}}.
    -   [ArchWiki: GNOME Files
        ](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GNOME_Files)
    -   Nautilus seems
        became leaner over years, I previously experienced  49M Res/25M Shr
        where now it is 27M/17M. Its dependencies are also now smaller,
        allowing to install it even if you don't use a full gnome desktop.
        _But for debian/ubuntu users take care that the recommended packages
        may add a lot of dependencies._
