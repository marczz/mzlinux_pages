# Inotify {#inotify}

[inotify](http://inotify.aiken.cz/) (GPL)
is an inode-base file system notification mechanism implementated in the linux kernel.

-   Wikipedia: {{< wp "inotify" >}}
-   Michael Kerrisk in [lwn.net](https://lwn.net) has written an
    introduction to inotify structure:
    [Filesystem notification, part 1: An overview of dnotify and inotify
    ][https://lwn.net/Articles/604686/),
    [part 2: A deeper investigation of inotify](https://lwn.net/Articles/605128/).

## Inotify tools
Tools and Programming languages API. The python tools are in the Python chapter in
the {{< iref "python_libraries#inotify" "Python Libraries - Inotify" >}} section.

-   [inotify tools](https://github.com/rvoicilas/inotify-tools/wiki#info)
    are tools to allow inotify's features to be used from within shell
    scripts. _inotify-tools is a debian package_.

    -   {{< man "inotifywatch(1)" >}} listens for filesystem events using
        Linux's {{< man "inotify(7)" >}} interface, then outputs a summary
        count of the events received on each file or directory.
    -   {{< man "inotifywait(1)" >}} waits for changes to files using
        {{< man "inotify(7)" >}} interface. It is suitable for waiting for
        changes to files from shell scripts. It can either exit once
        an event occurs, or continually execute and output events as
        they occur.

    For these two tools there are examples in the
    [inotify tools home page](https://github.com/rvoicilas/inotify-tools/wiki#info)

-   {{< iref "python_libraries#pydoit" "Doit" >}}
    is a python build tool that integrates inotify
-   [fsniper](https://github.com/l3ib/fsniper) (GPL)
    by Dave Foster is a C utility that waits for a file to be changed or created, and
    then executes a command on that file.
-   [incron](http://inotify.aiken.cz/?section=incron&page=doc)
    is an _inotify cron_ C compiled daemon and a table manipulator.
    Inotify cron handles filesystem events rather than time periods.
    It is a project unmaintained since 2012, the package was still in _buster_ but no
    longer in __bullseye_
-   [fswatch](https://github.com/emcrisostomo/fswatch/) (GPL)
    A cross-platform file change monitor with multiple backends, works on Linux with
    inotify, and also OS/X, BSD, Windows. _In Debian._
    -   [fswatch Home](http://emcrisostomo.github.io/fswatch/).
-   [IWatch](http://iwatch.sourceforge.net/) simple Perl script using inotify to watch
    files and directories, sending notifications of file changes by e-mail. The last
    release 2.2 of upstream branch is in 2009, The [Debian maintainer branch
    ](https://salsa.debian.org/debian/iwatch/) has made a lot of improvements to
    allow it to work with modern Debian distribution.
-   {{< man "tail" >}} when using  `tail --follow` uses inotify if it is available.

## Knowing who consume instances

You have a list of processes and used instances with:

    find /proc/*/fd/* -type l -lname 'anon_inode:inotify' -print| sort -t/ -k3 -n

## Controlling the number of watches

You can find maximum number of inotify instances in
`/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_instances` and the
maximum number of files watched in
`/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches`

The default maximum number of inotify watches is 8192

Use `tail -f` to verify if you exceed the inotify maximum watch limit.
as it uses inotify and If you've run out of your inotify watches,
you'll get this error:

    tail: inotify cannot be used, reverting to polling: Too many open files

### Knowing the current number of watches

To  know the current number of watches added by a process
-   Enable add_watches tracing with:

        echo 1 >|\
        /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/syscalls/sys_exit_inotify_add_watch/enable

-   Stop the process
-   Register watches

        cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_pipe \
            |grep '1234*inotify_add_watch' >/tmp/inotify_watches

-   Restart the process, and wait a while it setup its watches.
-   Count watches.

        wc -l /tmp/inotify_watches

-   Disable add_watches tracing with:

        echo 0 >|\
        /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/syscalls/sys_exit_inotify_add_watch/enable

The format is given in the file `/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/README`

You can have a list of the pids that have a inotify fd registered by

    sudo ls -l /proc/*/fd/* | grep notify

For more information on tracing look at
[kernel documentation: ftrace.txt
](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/trace/ftrace.txt).
and
[yocto project: tracing and profiling - ftrace
](https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Tracing_and_Profiling#ftrace).

## modifying the settings

Each watch has a cost following
[this post answer](http://askubuntu.com/a/155426) and the referred
link on a 64b system it uses 1kb/watch in the unswapable kernel memory
_(half on a 32b system)_, so the standard limit of 8192 watches is
consuming 8M.

To increase the Inotify watchers limit:

-   for a temporary change:

        echo 100000 > /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches

    or

        sysctl -w fs.inotify.max_user_watches=100000

-  for a permanent one write in `/etc/sysctl.conf`

        fs.inotify.max_user_watches=100000
