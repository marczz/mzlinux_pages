# Wayland {#wayland}

{{< iref "desktop#wayland_compositors" "Wayland Compositors" >}}.

{{< wp "Wayland_(display_server_protocol)"  "Wayland" >}} is a protocol between a
compositor and its clients. The compositor sends input events to the
clients. The clients render locally and then communicate video memory
buffers and information about updates to those buffers back to the
compositor.

It can replace X as the native Linux graphics server or collaborate
with X. Wayland is a graphics multiplexer for a number of X servers,

    is an Xorg server modified to use wayland input devices for input
    and forward either the root window or individual top-level windows
    as wayland surfaces. The server still runs the same 2D driver with
    the same acceleration code as it does when it runs natively. The
    main difference is that wayland handles presentation of the
    windows instead of KMS. xwayland is in debian.

You can also uses the web browsers _Firefox_, _Web (previously Epiphany)_, _Xombrero_, _Falcon_.

Wayland is completely supported in GTK 3.22, but many applications have components with
X.org dependencies, more information in [Initiatives/Wayland/GTK+ - GNOME Wiki!
](https://wiki.gnome.org/Initiatives/Wayland/GTK%2B).

Wayland should be recognized by the GTK application but it can be necessary to set the
environment variable:
~~~
$ export GDK_BACKEND=wayland
~~~

QT 5 support wayland using the QtWayland module. More information in
[QtWayland - Qt Wiki](https://wiki.qt.io/QtWayland), and

## Libinput {#libinput}
libinput is an input device driver for Wayland compositors and X.org window system.

-   [libinput documentation](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/libinput/doc/latest/)
-   [libinput - ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Libinput)
-   [libinput - Gentoo Wiki](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Libinput)

For wayland and modern Xorg release
{{< wp "Evdev" >}} is managed by libinput.

In a wayland compositor libinput is configured by the compositor. For Sway it is in
[sway-input(5)](https://manpages.debian.org/testing/sway/sway-input.5.en.html)

# Framebuffer
See also {{< iref "xterminals#framebuffer_terminals" "Framebuffer terminals" >}},
{{< iref "console_applications#framebuffer_applications" "Framebuffer Applications" >}}.

X.org _xf86-video-fbdev_ driver module provides framebuffer under
Xorg. It is in the package _xserver-xorg-video-fbdev_.

# Touchpad {#touchpad}
## Synaptics
In wayland and for recent Xorg release the touchpad is managed by
{{< iref "#libinput" >}} and synaptics is no more necssary. In Debian we install
`xserver-xorg-input-libinput`, `xserver-xorg-input-evdev`, `xserver-xorg-input-mouse`
and not synaptics.

But some features are still missing for touchpads in synaptics, according to
[Debian Wiki: SynapticsTouchpad](https://wiki.debian.org/SynapticsTouchpad)
we make ynaptics driver take precedence over libinput by copying
`/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf` into `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d`, so as to
make it take precendence over the libinput configuration file found at
`/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/90-libinput.conf`.

    gtk libraries.  GDM has numerous added features, but is dependent of gtk.

    Despite his name, you can use it without a full gnome environment, and he is
    appropriate with any gtk desktop. GDM has a nice configuration tool, that make its
    use a lot less painful than xdm. Although his virtual memory size is three or four
    time the xdm one *(14M against 4 on one of my desktop)* its resident size is quite
    close *(1.6M/1.1M)*.

start programs from the computer running the display manager, while their input and
output take place on the computer where the server (and the user) sits.

## XPRA {#xpra}
[Xpra](http://xpra.org/) (GPL)
is a multi-platform (linux, windows, OS-X) persistent remote
display server and client for forwarding applications and desktop
screens.

It gives you remote access to individual applications or full
desktops.  On X11 it allows you to run programs, usually on a
remote host, direct their display to your local machine, and then
to disconnect from these programs and reconnect from the same or
another machine, without losing any state. Unlike VNC, these
applications are "rootless".  They appear as individual windows
inside your window manager rather than being contained within
a single window.

It can also be used to forward full desktops, from X11 servers,
MS Windows, or Mac OS X.

Xpra also allows forwarding of sound, clipboard and printing
services.  Sessions can be accessed over SSH, or password
protected over plain TCP sockets.

Xpra can be used with  {{< iref "#winswitch" "winswitch" >}}.

Xpra is in Debian, and also a Debian repository is also
[available on the Xpra site](http://xpra.org/trac/wiki/Download#Linux).

## VNC Servers/client software

### Libvncserver based
[libvncserver](https://github.com/LibVNC/libvncserver) (GPL)
LibVNCServer/LibVNCClient are cross-platform C libraries.
there are an old project, but it is actively maintained in 2017.
It is the base of many clients and servers. The most known being
X11vnc.

[x11vnc](https://github.com/LibVNC/x11vnc)
is the VNC server, build
with LibVNCServer, previously part of the libvnc project, but now
in a separate repository since the version 0.9.14.

It has built-in SSL encryption and authentication, UNIX account
and password support, server-side scaling, single port HTTPS and
VNC, mDNS service advertising, and TightVNC and UltraVNC
file-transfer.

This is an old project, the core of the project comes from 0.9.13
year 2010 which is is packaged in Debian for version up to _buster_.

LibVNC and the GitHub community have taken over the development since 0.9.14.  on Jan 5,
2019 0.9.16 was released and is available in Debian _bullseye_. You can find
[the latest release on GitHub](https://github.com/LibVNC/x11vnc/releases/latest).

It can use as X display either the virtual framebuffer X server
[Xvfb](https://manpages.debian.org/unstable/xvfb/Xvfb.1.en.html)
which is available on most platforms and does not require root; or
Xdummy a wrapper script which until 9.13 was
[part of the x11vnc source code
](https://github.com/LibVNC/x11vnc/blob/187cb9f70d71353827ff2c01f9e0d65b767be071/misc/Xdummy) and
since 9.14 is a C program. An advantage of Xdummy over Xvfb is that
Xdummy supports {{< iref "#xrandr" "RANDR" >}} dynamic screen resizing.

    is a VNC viewer to Android powered by LibVNCServer.
-   [vncterm](https://github.com/LibVNC/vncterm) (GPL)
    contains two programs; LinuxVNC
    exports a virtual console sessions to any VNC client; and VNCommand
    executes a command redirecting stdin from a vncviewer and stdout &
    stderr to the vnc clients. _vncterm_ is a client
    splitted out from libvncserver. It is in Debian.

### TightVNC
[TightVNC](http://www.tightvnc.com/). (previously GPL)
is a VNC server, the data encoding is optimized for low
bandwidth connections. It was an improvement over vncserver, but
now is present in both servers. This server does not need a
display on the server machine. It is in the debian package
_tightvncserver_ for version 1.3.9.

Debian has TigerVnc package since _stretch_.

_TigerVnc_ can expose directly the X server like does {{< iref "#x11vnc" "X11VNC" >}}
through an Xorg extension _libvnc.so_, which is in Debian in a separate package
_tigervnc-xorg-extension_. You will use
[x0vncserver](http://tigervnc.org/doc/x0vncserver.html) to share the X display connected
to the physical screen remotely. Unlike [Xvnc](http://tigervnc.org/doc/Xvnc.html)  it
does not create a virtual display.

TigerVnc can be used with {{< iref "#virtualgl" "VirtualGL" >}} to acelerate
OpenGl rendering.
