replication, only unique blocks  that are not shared between the two SDFS volumes
are replicated.

-   SDFS works with AWS S3, AWS Glacier, Azure, Google, and most S3 compliant backends.
-   SDFS uses strong AES-CBC 256 bit encrytion, either when using local block
    storage _in this case metadata is not encrypted_, or when data is sent to the

            -   While rclone uses the modtime, syncrclone may use modtime or hashes,
                which make it more adapted on backends where the modification time is
                not available or not accurate.

# Comparison of storage plans {#comparison_table}

I don't include here Microsoft Azure or Amazon S3 as they are a lot more expensive, and
also the S3 price depends of a multitude of factor that must be examined for a
specific use case. For details refers to their price calculator like
[AWS pricing calculator](https://calculator.aws/#/).

For a rough estimate you may use
[Idrive price comparator](https://www.idrive.com/object-storage-e2/pricing), or
[Wasabi cost estimator](https://wasabi.com/cloud-storage-pricing/#cost-estimates)
or [backblaze cost calculator](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage-pricing.html)
which includes a comparison with S3, microsoft azure and google cloud.

Note that the fixed amount for some plans imply that for some volume of data the
cheapest plan is not the one noted above as lowest by TB/year.  If you want to host only
400GB Google one and Mega will cost 100â‚¬, Wasabi 84â‚¬, Scaleway 65â‚¬, kdrive 60â‚¬, OVH
openstack 48â‚¬, Hetzner 45â‚¬, Yandex 32.8â‚¬, Idrive 30â‚¬, Blackblaze B2 28$.

Of course the price is not the only criteria, it does not includes the ingress and
egress trafic, these storage have very different characteristics, some are
geographically replicated, they may or may not have backups and versioning, some are
block storage, some file storage, some are encrypted on the server, and the latency and
transfer throughput may largely vary.

The price do not include taxes, in Europe Community all countries are subject to VAT
with rates varying from 16% to 27% and for most of the countries between 19% and
25%. Even not in EU Swiss has a 7.7% rate and Great Britain 20%. When buying some
product from EU in a country outside EU, it is billed without taxes and the VAT is added
by the carrier. I have no idea on what apply to some abroad computer service. It is
still move complicated if we consider that the company can be outside of Europe but the
Data center is located
in EU.
