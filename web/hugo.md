[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is a static site generator written in go. It is in
Debian. Hugo can be used for documentation.

It uses since v 0.60 {{< iref "markdown#goldmark" "Goldmark" >}} for markdown
formatting, and {{< iref "source_code#chroma" Chroma >}} for
[syntax highlighting](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/).

There are many themes aimed to Documentation, you can find many in
[documentation | Hugo Themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/tags/documentation/).

I list some of them with a side bar menu, to alow a hierarchical documentation organized
as a book.

-   [Casper for Hugo](https://github.com/vjeantet/hugo-theme-casper)
    is not aimed to documentation, but is adapted to documentation by
    [BookStackApp](https://github.com/BookStackApp/website).
-   [hugo-theme-techdoc](https://github.com/thingsym/hugo-theme-techdoc)

These also have also a search _usually with lunr_ integrated.
-   [DocDock](https://docdock.netlify.com/original/),
    [GitHub - docdock](https://github.com/vjeantet/hugo-theme-docdock)
-   [hugo-book](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book)
-   [docuapi](https://github.com/bep/docuapi) is targeted to API documentation.

Examples of Documentation build with Hugo:

-   [GetBoostrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) the documentation of
    {{< iref "html#bootstrap" "BootStrap" >}}: [Get bootstap source
    ](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/tree/master/site).
