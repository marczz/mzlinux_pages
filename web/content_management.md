# content management system (CMS)

A **content management system (CMS)** is a computer software system
for organizing and facilitating collaborative creation of documents
and other content. We call **content management framework** an
application programming interface for creating a customized content
management system. I no longer use CMS and replaced them by static site generators so I
list only few links of general CMS.

Look also at {{< iref "static_sites" "Static Sites" >}},
