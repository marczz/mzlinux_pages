### ics import {#gcal_ics_import}

To import properly an icalendar ics file in google calendat, the
header should set the encoding, otherwise it is supposed to be
ascii and all UTF-8 characters are replaced by a question mark.

We check the header with

    curl -I http://url/to/icalendar.ics

And it should answer:

    Content-Type: text/calendar; charset=utf-8

Otherwise you should modify the header, in apache it is done by adding
in a `<Directory>` section or in the `.htaccess` file of the ical
repository.

    AddType 'text/calendar; charset=UTF-8' .ics
