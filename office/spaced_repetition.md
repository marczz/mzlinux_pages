## Incremental reading
 {{< wp "Incremental reading" >}} is  available in
    SuperMemo, Org-drill, and
    [incremental-reading](https://github.com/luoliyan/incremental-reading)
    Anki add-on.

# Main stream software.

The two more popular and achieved software are written in python
{{< wp "Anki" >}} (GNU AGPL) and  {{< wp "Mnemosyne_(software)"  "Mnemosyne" >}} (GPL).
Anki has a lot more feature. Anki 2 is based on the
[Sm2 algorithm from Piotr Wozniak](http://www.supermemo.com/english/ol/sm2.htm)
the reason to prefer it to other algorithm is
[stated in the Anki FAQ](http://ankisrs.net/docs/dev/manual.html#_what_spaced_repetition_algorithm_does_anki_use). Mnemosyne 2
use also a variant of sm2 algorithm as explained in the
[principles of MnemoSyne](http://mnemosyne-proj.org/principles.php). They
both are written with QT interface and use a sqlite3 database.

The synchronization is handled by both, but while Mnemosyne use a pair
to pair sync, Anki synchronize thru a central web interface. _Hosted Proprietary
web interface_.

They also both allow plugins but the
[Anki library of plugins](https://ankiweb.net/shared/addons/)
is a lot richer than the
[Mnemosyne plugins list](http://mnemosyne-proj.org/scripts-and-plugins).
