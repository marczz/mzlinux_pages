# Speech recognition

## self hosted software

-   [Mozilla DeepSpeec](https://deepspeech.readthedocs.io/) (MPL 2.0) DeepSpeech is an
    open source Speech-To-Text engine, using a model trained by machine learning
    techniques based on
    [Baidu’s Deep Speech research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5567).
    Project DeepSpeech uses Google’s
    [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) to make the implementation easier.
