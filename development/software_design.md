# Continuous Integration {#continuous_integration}
A concept closely related to {{< wp "Continuous integration" >}} is {{< wp "DevOps" >}}
_(DEVelopement & OPerationS)_ they both prone automation and monitoring
at all steps of software construction, from building, integration,
testing, releasing, deployment and infrastructure management.


{{< wp "Build automation" >}} refer to the process of compiling, testing and packaging.
This term was coined to refer to the process traditionally handled by _Make_ and
_Autotools_ for programs in language C. _Continuous Integration_ _(CI)_ is a more recent
concept which came with the development of source control. We can see _Build automation_
as a lower level part of _CI_, we hold this view in these pages, but some people
classify _CI_ as a _build automation_ category!
