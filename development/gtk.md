-   [GTK home page](http://www.gtk.org/) (and Gimp toolkit)
-   The Gnome library {{< wp "GLib" >}} is a cross-platform  library that began as part of
    the {{< wp "GTK+" >}} project but contain now non-GUI-specific code.
    _Glib_ provides the core object system used in Gnome {{< wp "GObject" >}}), the main loop
    implementation, and a large set of utility functions for strings and
    common data structures. It provides typedefs to ensure portability
    and a large set of containers.
-   {{< wp "GObject" >}} (LGPL) The GLib Object System, or GObject, is a library
    that provides a portable object system.  Gobject depens on Glib
    and libc and is used by GTK+ (and so by gnome) and gnome.<br />
    GObject is used by the programming languages

    accessing the widgets built in the loading process, .glade files
    are generated by the Glade application.
