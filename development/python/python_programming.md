# Python coding style
The page {{< iref "structured_text" "Structured text formatters" >}}
references many python formatters like the docutil restructured text,
asciidoc, markdown, txt2tags ....

    Numpy provide the Sphinx extension [numpydoc](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpydoc)
    to support docstrings in Numpy format.

# Documentation tools
-   [Python Wiki: Documentation tools](https://wiki.python.org/moin/DocumentationTools)
-   [Documenting Python](http://www.python.org/doc/current/doc/doc.htm)
    by Fred L. Drake describes the document classes
    and special markup used in the Python documentation.
-   [Epydoc](http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/)
    <a name="epydoc"></a> ( MIT open-source license) a documentation generator that
    renders its own lightweight markup language Epytext as well as
    {{< iref "structured_text#reStructuredText" "reStructuredText" >}}
    for Python documentation strings.
    Epytext supports linking between different pieces of documentation.</br>
    It has been the most popular api documentation generator, but is by now often replaced by
    {{< iref "#apidoc" "sphinx-apidoc" >}}, and is now stalled.</br>
-   [pdoc](http://pdoc.burntsushi.net/pdoc) is a new fork of epydoc,
     and intend to continue the development of the now inactive epydoc.
-   [pydoc](http://docs.python.org/3/lib/module-pydoc.html)
     the native documentation generator of python uses the
    [Documentation Strings
    ](http://docs.python.org/3.3/tutorial/controlflow.html#tut-docstrings)
    included in the code.
-   [pydoctor](https://launchpad.net/pydoctor)
    is a documentation generator that replaced epydoc for the
    twisted project. Pydoctor depends on twisted and Nevow.
-   [Pylookup](http://taesoo.org/Opensource/Pylookup) by Taesoo Kim
    is a mode to search python documents especially within emacs.
-   {{ iref "web#sphinx" "Sphinx" >}} is a tool originally to build HTML and PDF
    documentation using reStructuredText. It has support for highlighting source with
    Pygment and autogenerating documentation from source code with the
    [autodoc extension](http://sphinx-doc.org/ext/autodoc.html).
    The [extension autosummary] generates function/method/attribute summary lists,
    similar to those output e.g. by Epydoc and other API doc generation tools.
-   <a name=apidoc></a>[sphinx-apidoc
    ](http://sphinx-doc.org/man/sphinx-apidoc.html)
    is a tool for automatic generation of Sphinx sources that,
    using the autodoc extension. It document a whole package in the
    style of
    {{< iref "#epydoc" "epydoc" >}}
    or related documentation tools.

The documentation of python can be done using
{{< iref "source_code#literate_programming" "Literate Programming" >}},
we can use a langage agnostic tool, or one of the manifold python literate tools.
See the references to Cog, pyreport , pyWeb, PyLit in the
{{< iref "source_code#literate_programming" "Literate Programming Section" >}}


# Static Code Analyzers
-   [PyCQA](http://meta.pycqa.org/en/latest/)
    or _Python Code Quality Authority_ is an organization which group
    projects in the domain of automatic style and quality reporting.
    -   [GitHub - PyCQA](https://github.com/PyCQA)
-   [PyChecker](http://pychecker.sourceforge.net/) (BSD License)
    was a python syntax checker for python 2.x. PyChecker has a faster
    alternative  {{< iref "#pyflakes" "Pyflakes" >}}.
    Pychecker was limited to Python 2.
-   <a name=pylint></a>[PyLint](http://www.pylint.org/) (GPL)
    includes PyChecker checks, plus checking line-code's
    length, checking if variable names are well-formed, checking if declared
    interfaces are truly implemented ... Pylint support python 3.5+
    -  [Pylint User Manual](http://docs.pylint.org/).
       You can configure the rules used by pylint by a `.pylintrc` file,
       the defaults are given by: `pylint --generate-rcfile`.
-    <a name=pyflakes"></a>[Pyflakes](https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes)
    is program to analyze Python programs and detect various errors.
    Pylint import the analyzed module but Pyflakes only parse the source file,
    so it is safe to use on modules with side effects.
    It supports Python: 2.7 and > 3.4
-   [pycodestyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle)
    (MIT _Expat_ Licence)
    formerly pep8.py is a Python PEP 8 code style checker
    that can be used both for Python 2.x and Python 3.x.
    -   [pycodestyle documentation
        ](http://pycodestyle.pycqa.org/en/latest/)
-   [PEP257.py]( https://github.com/halst/pep257)
    is a docstring style checker by Vladimir Keleshev.
-   [Black](https://github.com/ambv/black) (MIT Licence)
    is a Python code formatter. It intentionally does not allow to
    choose your own rules, its ensure that all black formatted code
    have a common look.



# Encoding
# Python 2 vs. python 3 encoding
-   [chardet](http://chardet.feedparser.org/)
    is an universal encoding detector library for python 2 and 3, that attempt
    to guess the text encoding from its content.
-   [encutils](http://www.python.org/pypi/encutils)
    is a library of helper functions to deal with encodings of text
    files via HTTP and directly.
-   [Python Unicode HOWTO](http://www.amk.ca/python/howto/unicode)
    is for python 2.x
-   [Python 3 Unicode HOWTO](http://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html) is
    updated for the new _3.x_ use of text (_str_) and data (_bytes_).
-   [Practical Python porting for systems programmers
    ](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/practical-python-porting/)
    by Peter A. Donis and [Eric S. Raymond](http://www.catb.org/esr/)
    examine the porting from Python 2 to 3.

## Unicode memo

-   Representation of text has
    [changed a lot since v 3.0
    ](http://docs.python.org/3.1/whatsnew/3.0.html#text-vs-data-instead-of-unicode-vs-8-bit).

-   Now python name _text_ what was previously called _unicode_ but
    the type is the new _str_,  and the old _str_ is now _bytes_.

    You no longer use _u"..."_ for text but you have to use _b"..."_ for _bytes_.

-   Python has a clear distinction between _text_ and _data_ the text "au cœur de l'été"
    has 16 characters, if you want to represent these characters as data, you need to
    convert them using an _encoding_, these encoding can use a fixed number of bytes to
    render a single character as do `ascii`, `iso-8859-1` or `utf-32` _but ascii or
    iso-8859-1 cannot render the previous text_ or a variable number of bytes like
    `utf-8` or `utf-16`.

- In python 2.6 _in an utf-8 terminal_ you write:

~~~~
>>> s=u"au cœur de l'été"
>>> type(s)
<type 'unicode'>
>>> len(s)
16
>>> print s
au cœur de l'été
>>> print repr(s)
u"au c\u0153ur de l'\xe9t\xe9"
>>> print s.encode('utf-8')
au cœur de l'été
>>> type(s.encode('utf-8'))
<type 'str'>
>>> len(s.encode('utf-8'))
19
>>> print repr( s.encode('utf-8'))
"au c\xc5\x93ur de l'\xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9"
>>> len(s.encode('utf-16'))
34
>>> print repr(s.encode('utf-16'))
"\xff\xfea\x00u\x00 \x00c\x00S\x01u\x00r\x00 \x00d\x00e\x00 \x00l\x00'\x00\xe9\x00t\x00\xe9\x00"
~~~~

If you yse python 3.1 it turns out to:

~~~~
>>> s="au cœur de l'été"
>>> type(s)
<class 'str'>
>>> print(s)
au cœur de l'été
>>> print(repr(s))
"au cœur de l'été"
>>> print(s.encode('utf-8'))
b"au c\xc5\x93ur de l'\xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9"
>>> type(s.encode('utf-8'))
<class 'bytes'>
>>> len(s.encode('utf-8'))
19
>>> print(repr( s.encode('utf-8')))
b"au c\xc5\x93ur de l'\xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9"
~~~~

# Data model {#data_model}

-   Wikipedia {{< wp "Python_philosophy#Programming_philosophy"  "Python Programming philosophy" >}}
-   Python support {{< wp "Duck typing" >}}, that allow a behavioral rather than family approach to classes.
    _You recognize a duck because it quarks rather to check if it's parents are duck too_.
-   In Python Duck typing can be complemented by
    [Abstract Base Classes (abc)](http://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html),
    it allows you to see your class as an instance of the (abstract) base class.
    They are defined in
    [PEP 3119 -- Introducing Abstract Base Classes](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3119/)
-   Abstract Base Classes is peculiar case of {{< iref "#metaclasses" "Metaclass" >}}
    that act as templates for producing classes.
-   The Python data model unify types and classes, it used to be
    called {{< iref "#newstyle_classes" "New Style Classes" >}}
-   Python allows higher type programming, the functions
    transformation are clarified by {{< iref "#decorators" "Decorators" >}}.
-   Python attributes of a class are not limited to data members
    but can be  an instance of a class that implements special methods
    to get and set the value of the attribute. Such class is called a
    {{< iref "#descriptors" "Descriptor" >}}

## Python 2 New Style classes and Python 3 classes {#newstyle_classes}
-   The data model for python 2.x first used _classic classes_ with two distincts concepts of
    _type_ and _class_  the
    [new-style  classes](http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html#newstyle)
    have been introduced to unify classes and types.
    A new-style class is neither more nor less than a user-defined type.
    Note that _new style classes_ are the only class model since 3.0
    since old-style classes are removed .
-   [Unifying types and classes in Python 2.2
    ](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.2.3/descrintro/1)

    is expounded in the chandler wiki
    [The Long and Short of Using super
    ](http://chandlerproject.org/Projects/UsingSuper).
-   James Knight warns you against difficulties of using super in
    [Python's Super is nifty, but you can't use it
    ](http://fuhm.net/super-harmful/).
    It is further expanded in Michele Simionato

## Decorators {#decorators}

-   Bruce Eckel gives a very comprehensive tutorial to _decorators_ in his three articles:
    [Decorators I: Introduction to Python Decorators
    ](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=240808),

    ](http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/charming_python_b26.html) _2005_
    by David Mertz, this last paper shows how to define _instance_
    descriptors, most other examples are _class_ descriptors.
-   [Python Descriptors](http://www.informit.com/articles/printerfriendly.aspx?p=1309289) _2008_

-   [Python 3k: functions: property
    ](http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#property)
    defines properties and the use of the `@property` decorator.

## Metaclasses {#metaclasses}

Metaclasses have changed in Python 3, so be careful of tweaking the syntax of the Python 2 recipes.
I include only references on the python 3 metaclasses

-   Wikipedia: {{< wp "Metaclass" >}}

    [pylities](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytilities/), read the [pylities Manual](http://pytilities.sourceforge.net/doc/1.2.0/)


## {{< wp "Design by contract" >}}

{{< wp "Design by contract" >}} define formal, precise and verifiable interface specifications for software components, which extend the ordinary definition of abstract data types with preconditions, postconditions and invariants. These specifications are referred to as "contracts".
The concept of design by contract as been first deployed with the language _Eiffel_ and you will find introductions and material to use this paradigm in the [Eiffel: design by contract](lhttp://www.eiffel.com/developers/design_by_contract.html) page.

The [PEP 316- Programming by Contract for Python
](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0316/) is implemented by the library
[contract](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/contract/) which is not updated
since 2007.

The library [PyContracts](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyContracts)
is a more recent attempt using decorators to implement contracts in Python.

## Polymorphism

Python is a dynamically typed language, polymorphism in dynamically
and statically typed languages is described in
[Wikipedia Polymorphism in object-oriented
programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_in_object-oriented_programming#Python).

It his book [Building Skills in Python](http://homepage.mac.com/s_lott/books/python/htmlchunks/ "homepage.mac.com/s_lott books/python") Steven F. Lott
[introduces python polymorphism](http://homepage.mac.com/s_lott/books/python/htmlchunks/ch22s02.html "homepage.mac.com/s_lott ch22s02.html").

The polymorphism in python is on the class of the object on which the method is called. We cannot use operator
overloading
to solve polymorphism on other arguments as we can do in a statycally strong typing language as C++.
This asymmetry is pointed out by David Merz in his  article
[Multiple Dispatch Generalizing Polymorphism with Multimethods
](http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/charming_python_b12.html).

[Multiple dispatch (wikipedia)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_dispatch)
differ from overloading in that the called function is choosed based on the run time dynamic type and not on a compiled
type computed static type.
[Multiple dispatch in python](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_dispatch#Python)
uses library extension as described in the previous article of David
Merz or the _multimethod decorator_ described buy
Guido van van Rossum in his article
[Five-minute Multimethods in Python](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=101605").

There are many packages to implement multiple dispatch:
[pymultimethods](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pymultimethods/),
[multimethods](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/multimethod/),
[PEAK-Rules](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PEAK-Rules).

Note that use of multiple dispatch can imply the use of _isinstance_ that adepts of Duck Typing
[consider harmful](http://www.canonical.org/~kragen/isinstance/)


# Python idioms
## __with__ construct

The usage of the with statement is often quite confusing, and most people use it only to open files `with open('somefile') as file:`. But is is a lot more powerfull than only aimed at cleanly close files.

We have first to read the [Python language documentation
](http://docs.python.org/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-with-statement)
without forgetting [context managers
](http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html#context-managers).

A first very useful tutorial is composed of articles of Frederik
Lundh:
[The with statement](http://effbot.org/pyref/with.htm),
[With Statement Contexts and Context Managers
](http://effbot.org/pyref/context-managers.htm),
the main one being
[Understanding Python's "with" statement
](http://effbot.org/zone/python-with-statement.htm)
wich offers comprehensive examples.

The main reference is [PEP 343: The "with" Statement
](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0343/) it is itself very detailed
and offers many useful examples.

As the main task is to define context managers you may want to use the
[contextlib module](http://docs.python.org/library/contextlib.html)
see also Doug Hellmann tutorial
[contextlib – Context manager utilities
](https://pymotw.com/3/contextlib/index.html)

    [the effbot.org guide to The Standard Python Library](http://www.effbot.org/librarybook/)
    gives some examples of use of the network modules from the standard
    library.

# Unit Tests {#python_unit_tests}
This is the __Python__ Unit Test section; an other page deals with
the non language specific, software design idiom of
{{< iref "software_design#unit_tests" "Unit Tests" >}}.

-   [Python testing tools taxonomy](http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonTestingToolsTaxonomy)
    is the python wiki index of  testing tools.
-   [Agile Testing Articles and Tutorials](http://pycheesecake.org/wiki/AgileTestingArticlesAndTutorials)
    contains links to articles and tutorials (mainly using python)
    from Grig Gheorghiu's
    [Agile Testing Blog](http://agiletesting.blogspot.com/).
-   [Cheesecake project](http://www.pycheesecake.org/wiki/)
    is aimed as python package quality assurance and quality
    measurement. Cheesecake use nose for automatic testing, and require
    pylint and setuptools.
-   [Dive Into Python3](http://getpython3.com/diveintopython3/) by
    Mark Pilgrim has a
    [chapter on unit testing](http://getpython3.com/diveintopython3/unit-testing.html)
    which is a very good tutorial.


We  consider three ways of testing: _doctest_, _unit tests_ and _Mock objects_.
There are packages for these three validations methods in the
{{< iref "python_libraries#modules" "standard library modules" >}}
and in Pypi packages.

A [doctest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctest "Wikipedia page")
allows the generation of tests based on output from the
standard Python interpreter shell, cut and pasted into docstrings.
It searches for pieces of text that look like interactive Python
sessions, and then executes those sessions to verify that they work
exactly as shown. The library reference includes the
{{< iref  "python_libraries#doctest" "doctest module" >}}

{{< wp "Unit Test" >}} are helped by the module
{{< iref "python_libraries#unittest" "UnitTest" >}}

Since python 3.3 there is a new module for {{< wp "Mock Objects" >}}:
{{< iref "python_libraries#unittest" "unittest.mock" >}}.

The other libraries are under the section
{{< iref "python_libraries#test_libs" "Test Libraries" >}}.
