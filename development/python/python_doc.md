    They are built by using the in-browser implementation of Python
    [Skulpt](http://www.skulpt.org/), and a set of plugins to sphinx,
    that allow to embed active code (using Skulpt), to give asessments using multiple
    choice questions with answers, to step through small code examples using a module
    built upon the [Online Python Tutor ](http://pythontutor.com/) and to embed video in
    sphinx
    </br>
    All sphinx extensions, are available with the full source
    of the books in the

# Python implementations
[Python Wiki: Python Implementations](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonImplementations)

-   {{< wp "CPython" >}} is the default implementation of  Python. It is written in C.
     CPython is a bytecode interpreter. It has a foreign function interface with several languages including C.
-   {{< wp "IronPython" >}} (Apache License) is an implementation Python 2.7
    targeting the .NET Framework and Mono.
-   [Jython (Wikipedia)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jython) (Python PSF derived licence)
    ([jython project](http://www.jython.org/)
    [Jython Wiki](https://wiki.python.org/jython/))
    is an implementation of the Python
    programming language written in Java. Jython programs can
    seamlessly import and use any Java class. jythonc is a compiler
    that converts Python source code into Java bytecode. Jython is compatible with puthon 2.7.
-   <a name="pypy"></a>[Pypy](http://pypy.org/) (MIT License)
    is a python translator to lower level languages
    such as C, [LLVM](http://llvm.org/), jvm, javascript, or CIL.
    It includes a Just-in-time Compiler. Pypy support both python 2 and 3.
    -    Wikipedia {{< wp "PyPy" >}} page.
-   [Pyston](https://github.com/dropbox/pyston) (Apache License)
    Pyston takes parsed Python code and transforms it to the LLVM intermediate representation,
    which  is then run through the LLVM optimizer and passed off to the LLVM JIT engine.
    It employs type speculation to guess the type of the value that a variable will receive
    and can inline functions.
    -   [Pyston Blog](http://blog.pyston.org)
-   [Skulpt](http://www.skulpt.org/) (MIT License)
    is an entirely in-browser javascript implementation of Python.
