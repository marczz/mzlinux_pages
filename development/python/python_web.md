# HTTP Libraries {#http_libraries}
## standard library modules
The standard library provides libraries for working with the web protocol.

There are examples of use of these libraries in
[The Internet â€” PyMOTW](https://pymotw.com/3/internet_protocols.html).

-   [http.client](http://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html)
    implement the client side of the HTTP and HTTPS protocols.
    It is normally  used though the
    {{< iref "#urllib" "utllib module" >}}.
-   <a name="http_cookies"></a>[http.cookies
    ](http://docs.python.org/3/library/http.cookies.html)
    abstract the concept of cookies, an HTTP state management mechanism.  It supports
    both simple string-only cookies, and also any serializable data-type as cookie
    value, it is principally useful for server-side code; see following
    {{< iref  "#http_cookiesjar" "http_cookiesjar"  >}}  for  client side
    processing.
    -   [PyMOTW: HTTP Cookie](https://pymotw.com/3/http.cookies/).
-   <a name="http_cookiesjar"></a>[http.cookiesjar
    ](http://docs.python.org/3/library/http.cookiejar.html)
    handle reading of HTTP cookies for a web client.
    {{< iref  "#urllib_request" "urllib.request" >}}
    also returns a _http.cookiesjar_ as attribute of the class _HTTPCookieProcessor_.

    The {{< iref "#request" "Requests package" >}} offer an enhancement of
    _http.cookiejar_ which exposes a dict interface. in the class [RequestsCookieJar
    ](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/api/#requests.cookies.RequestsCookieJar).
-   <a name="urllib"></a>[urllib module](http://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.html)
    provides a simple interface for network resource access. It is split in several
    submodules:
    -   <a name="urllib_request"></a>[urllib.request
        ](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html)
        is the main _urllib_ module, it is for opening URLs (mostly HTTP) using basic
        and digest authentication, redirections, cookies, etc.

        _The {{< iref "#request" "Requests package" >}} is
        recommended for a higher-level http client interface._

    -   _urllib.error_ containing the exceptions raised by urllib.request,
    -   [urllib.parse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html)
        for parsing URLs,
    -   _urllib.robotparser_ for parsing robots.txt files.

## Third party modules

-   [httplib2](https://github.com/httplib2/httplib2)(MIT License)
     is an HTTP/HTTPS client library with support for authentication
     basic digest or [WS-Security](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WS-Security),
     redirects, compression.
     -   [httplib2 Documentation](http://httplib2.readthedocs.io/)
-   <a name="request"></a>[Requests](https://github.com/psf/requests) (Apache2 License)
    or _HTTP for humans_ by [Kenneth Reitz](https://kennethreitz.org/)
    is an improvement of _urllib_ powered by _httplib_ and
    {{< iref "#urllib3" "urllib3" >}}. _request_ allow you to send HTTP/1.1
    requests. You can add headers, form data, multipart files, and parameters with
    simple Python dictionaries, and access the response data in the same way.
    _Request is in Pypi an Debian._

    _urllib3 is in Pypi an Debian._
    -   [urllib3 documentation](http://urllib3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
-   [httpx](https://github.com/encode/httpx)
    is a client for Python 3, which provides sync and async APIs, and support for both
    HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2, and can make requests directly to {{< iref "#wsgi" "WSGI" >}}
    applications or {{< iref "#asgi" "ASGI" >}}  applications.

# WSGI {#wsgi}

[WSGI or Web Server Gateway Interfaces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WSGI)
define an interface between web servers and web applications or
{{< iref "#web_frameworks" "Web frameworks" >}} for the Python
programming language.

Numerous Web application frameworks are
[supporting WSGI](http://wsgi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/frameworks.html):
see the {{< iref "#web_frameworks" "framework section" >}}

-   The   [new wsgi specification PEP 3333](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/)
    for python 3 updates

    the reference implementation for python 2 that is standard since python 2.5,
-   The python module is [wsgiref](https://docs.python.org/3/library/wsgiref.html).

    Quoting the module introduction:
    _wsgiref can be used to add WSGI support to a web server or
    framework. It provides utilities for manipulating WSGI environment
    variables and response headers, base classes for implementing WSGI
    servers, a demo HTTP server that serves WSGI applications, and a
    validation tool that checks WSGI servers and applications for
    conformance to the WSGI specification_.

[wsgi.org](http://www.wsgi.org/) has a list of
[Servers which support WSGI](http://www.wsgi.org/en/latest/servers.html).

-   To test wsgi applications one needs a simple wsgi server. You can play with
    servers:
    [wsgiref.simple_server
    ](http://docs.python.org/3/library/wsgiref.html#module-wsgiref.simple_server)
    from  [wsgiref](http://docs.python.org/3/library/wsgiref.html)

    -   See below in the {{< iref "#wsgi_servers" "wsgi Servers section" >}} how
        uWSGI can be used with apache, nginx, lighttpd, and cherokee.
-   Applications can also be tested with
    [WebTest](http://pythonpaste.org/webtest/) that provides an interface to run WSGI applications
    and verify the output without starting
    an HTTP server.<br />
    Ian Bicking has a
    [WebTest Howto](http://blog.ianbicking.org/2010/04/02/webtest-http-testing/)

-   {{< iref "apache" "Apache" >}}
    provides a wsgi [mod_wsgi](http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/) module.
    It allows also to run uwsgi with [Apache2 mod_uwsgi or mod_proxy_uwsgi
    ](http://projects.unbit.it/uwsgi/wiki/RunOnApache2).
-   {{< iref "nginx" "nginx" >}}.
    has also its [wsgi module](http://wiki.nginx.org/NginxNgxWSGIModule)
    and alternatively can also
    [delegate to uwsgi](http://projects.unbit.it/uwsgi/wiki/RunOnNginx)
    or act as a reverse proxy in front of {{< iref "#gunicorn" "Gunicorn" >}}
-   {{< iref "lighttpd" "Lighttpd" >}}
    recommends to run wsgi via FastCGI in its
    [HOW-TO WSGI](http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/4/wiki/Howto_WSGI).
    There is an [experimental uwsgi module](http://projects.unbit.it/uwsgi/wiki/RunOnLighttpd)

##  WSGI Libraries
As a WSGI Library is the heart of a Web framework you may want to look also at the
{{< iref "#web_frameworks" "Web Frameworks section" >}}

The {{< iref "#http_libraries" "http libraries" >}}
can also be used for wsgi programming, but are mainly used on the client side.

[wsgi.org](http://www.wsgi.org/) has lists of
[Middleware and libraries for WSGI
](http://www.wsgi.org/en/latest/libraries.html),
[Frameworks that run on WSGI](http://www.wsgi.org/en/latest/frameworks.html)

## ASGI {#asgi}

ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) is a successor to WSGI,
intended to provide a standard interface between async-capable Python web servers,
frameworks, and applications.

It is conceived to overcome WSGI limitations which make it unable to handle
long-lived connections, like you get with long-poll HTTP or WebSocket connections.

-   [ASGI Documentation](https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
    contains Introduction, Specifications,  Extensions, Implementations.
