# Literate Programming {#literate_programming}

This section is about literate programming and source code
documentation, if you extract both the code and documentation from the
same piece of text, you do
literate programming. If you extract your doc from your program,
you are doing source code documentation. But there is no crisp barrier
between the two concepts.

The two main components in traditional literate programming languages
like {{< wp "WEB" >}} or {{< wp "CWEB" >}} are *tangle*, which produces compilable code
from the source texts, and *weave*, which produces nicely-formatted
documentation.

There is a related

    generation as described in
