_I have also set a [git-memo](http://git-memo.mzlinux.org/)
which gives some reminders and explanations on git use._

-   [Git](http://git-scm.com) is a
    GPL distributed source code management tool.
    Git is born following the withdraw of free use of
    BitKeeper for free software, it has been developped by the Linux
    Kernel team to replace BitKeeper for the kernel source Management,
    this and more is explained in the very detailled
    [Wikipedia: Git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29)

GitHub has help pages explaining [how to create a Gist
](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-gists) and
[clone or fork it
](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/forking-and-cloning-gists).

-   [gist.el](https://github.com/defunkt/gist.el) (GPL) is an emacs interface to gist, it
    allows to create, view and modify gists from emacs.
-   [yagist](https://github.com/mhayashi1120/yagist.el) is a clone of gist.
-   [defunkt/gist](https://github.com/defunkt/gist) ( MIT License)
    is a ruby command line gist client. It allows to create, update, adds a description,
    paste from the clipboard to gist, list all gists, print content, delete your gists.
-   [jdowner/gist](https://github.com/jdowner/gist) (MIT License)
    a python command line gist client. It allows to create, edit the file, updates the
    description, list gists, clone, delete, list files, creates a tarball, print
    content, output detailed information, print version of your gists.

The {{< iref "#github-cli" "GitHub official client gh" >}} allows to create a gist.
Examples:
``` sh
# publish file 'hello.py' as a public gist
$ gh gist create --public hello.py
# create a private gist from output piped from another command, and gives a description
$ ls -la ~/this/directory | gh gist create -d "Content of ~/this/directory"
```

Gist are just git repositories, you ca
$ git clone git@gist.github.com:12345678901234567890.git mygist
```

    Work on it locally and publish your changes:
``` sh
$ cd mygist
$ ls
mygist.org
$ emacs mygist.org
..... edit and change the file
$ git commit mygist.org -m"refactored, improved, and fixed errors."
$ git push origin
......
To gist.github.com:12345678901234567890.git
  11c738a..d06a13d  master -> master
```

[Bl.ocks](https://bl.ocks.org/) is a simple viewer for sharing code examples hosted on
GitHub Gist.  You put in your gist an html document with relative links to other files
in your Gist, such as images, scripts or stylesheets; a Readme.md in markdown a `.block`
YAML configuration, and _Bl.ocks_ serve your page. Look at
this [example source](https://gist.github.com/mbostock/1353700),

## Sensitive information
-   [git-remote-gcrypt](https://spwhitton.name/tech/code/git-remote-gcrypt/)
    (GPL-3.0)
    is a git remote helper to push and pull from repositories encrypted with GnuPG. It
    works with the standard git transports, including repository hosting services like
    GitHub. There is a Debian package.

    Supported locations are `local`, `sftp://`, `rsync://user@host/path` and
    `rclone://remote:subdir` where the repository is stored as a set of files, or instead
    any `<giturl>` where gcrypt will store the same representation in a git repository,
    bridged over arbitrary git transport.

    Using an arbitrary `<giturl>` or an `sftp://` URI requires uploading the entire
    repository history with each push.  The `rsync://` transport _(not git rsync!)_,
    performs incremental pushes.

    is a C++ program that enables transparent encryption and decryption of files in a
    git repository. You can choose files which are encrypted when committed, and
    decrypted when checked out.  This lets you store your secret material (such as keys
    or passwords) in the same repository as your code, without requiring you to lock
    down your entire repository.
    -   [git-crypt - GitHub](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt)
-   [git secret](http://git-secret.io/) (MIT License)
    is a bash script which stores gpg encrypted credential inside source code git
    repository.

    _git secret_ is similar to _git-crypt_, but written as a script while git-crypt is a
    binary program. _git-crypt_ also has an has an option to export a symmetric key,
    that is not available in _git-secret_.  With _git-secret_ you can simply
    encrypt/decrypt files with gpg commands which is [harder with git-crypt
    ](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt/issues/99#issuecomment-270179200).

-   [SparkleShare](http://www.sparkleshare.org/) is a collaboration and sharing tool
    that uses a git repository backend.  It is written in mono and uses libnotify (with
    python and dbus services) to monitor files so it has quite heavy dependencies.

    is a lighter alternative to SparkleShare.  It watch files and folders in specified
    paths and sync them in a git or mercurial repository.  It needs pynotify (python),
    xmppy and a provided patched JabberBot. The project has a very low activity _last

# Git Workflow {#git_worflow}
## What are git workflows
There are a great number of species of git workflows with their
varieties each one having multiple forms. To have a taste of if you
can begin with the [Chapter 5 of Pro Git: Distributed Git
](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Distributed-Workflows).

In the same way than the {{< wp "Species problem" >}} in biology git workflows
is a controversial subject, with his proponents of eugenics an genetic
diversity defensors.

A lot of people publish on the web their git workflow.
 But all of them don't use git in the same context.
Some are individual developers, some other maintain
a big project with many contributors....

In any case it is useful to read about experimented people practice.
They met traps, either in their own way of doing, or have observed pitfalls
in other practices and their advice can avoid to expose
ourself or our friends to the same traps.

## Basis of git worflow
A good introduction is the [previously cited chapter
](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Distributed-Workflows)
of the book of Scott Chacon.

The the git documentation is a secure basis for choosing a workflow :
[Git Manual](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html),
[Everyday GIT](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/giteveryday.html)
and [gitworflows](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitworkflows.html)
(or in [git-scm: gitworkflows](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitworkflows/en))
based on the understanding of
[git-merge](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html)
and [git-rebase](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-rebase.html).

The [git wiki: GitWorkflows
](https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/GitWorkflows)
gives useful tips.

I read them again and again whenever I feel to switch to a more fashionable workflow.

## Git-Flow
[A successful Git branching model
](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
is Vincent Driessen's branching model. He has written
[git-flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow)
a git extensions to provide high-level repository operations along this model.

There are explanation of this model in the
[git-flow Wiki](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow/wiki/), and it is made clear in
[git-flow cheatsheet](https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/index.html).

Benjamin Sandofsky in
[Understanding the Git Workflow](http://sandofsky.com/blog/git-workflow.html)
warn us against the overuse of non fast forward merges used in Vincent
Driessen's model _because it breaks bisect and blame_ mainly when
merging raw checkpoints, and advise to prefer a squash merge for short
developments or a rebase of the topic branch before merge.

Scott Chacon
[GitHub Flow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html)
points out the advantages of *git-flow*
> A flexible workflow that works for lots of developers in a fairly straightforward manner

He speaks also some of its issues and why GitHub uses a much simpler
Git workflow.

### GitHub Flow {#github_flow}
-   [Understanding the GitHub flow · GitHub Guides
    ](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
-   [GitHub flow - GitHub Docs
    ](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/github-flow#following-the-github-flow)
-   [Git Scm: Contributing to a Project, GitHub Flow
    ](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project)
-   [HubFlow](http://datasift.github.io/gitflow/)
    explains how adapt GitFlow and the GitFlow tools git extension for working with
    GitHub.

    This topic is also discussed by Pedro Melo in
    [Flow setups for git
    ](http://www.simplicidade.org/notes/archives/2012/09/flow_setups_for.html).

## Merge or rebase
Vincent Driessen's git-flow use heavily merges at many levels.

The [Git Manual](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html)
explains
[why bisecting merge commits can be harder than bisecting linear history
](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#bisect-merges)
and concludes:

> many experienced git users, even when working on an otherwise
> merge-heavy project, keep the history linear by rebasing against the
> latest upstream version before publishing.

The [Git Workflow for Agile Teams
](http://reinh.com/blog/2009/03/02/a-git-workflow-for-agile-teams.html)
show also how to rebase before merge. Randy Fay take the same approach with
[A Rebase Workflow for Git](http://randyfay.com/node/91) this two posts are from 2009
and 2011.

As Randy Fay noted later the present way of acting is with
[pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)
used in [GitHub workflow](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flow/)
and detailed in the pages from
[Proposing changes to your work with pull requests
](https://help.github.com/articles/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/)

Kumar McMillan's
[Using topic branches and interactive rebasing effectively
](http://blog.mozilla.com/webdev/2011/11/21/git-using-topic-branches-and-interactive-rebasing-effectively/)
shows also when fast forwarding and when avoiding it.

When your head is spinning and you are like a Buridan’s Ass between a
rebased stack of hay and a merged pail of water, you can read this
[post from Linus Torvald](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/681763)
([thread view](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/681712/focus=681763))

> Rebasing branches is absolutely not a bad thing for individual developers.
But it *is* a bad thing for a subsystem maintainer....

In short it may be wise to follow the
[manual](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html)
and apply your topic branches by
[creating the perfect patch series
](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#patch-series).
