# Markdown Editing
[Emacs Markdown Mode](http://jblevins.org/projects/markdown-mode/)
by Jason Blevinsis the standard major mode for editing Markdown
formatted text with Emacs.

Markdown Mode can export the buffer to html and preview it (key
`C-c C-c v`). Live Export (`C-c C-c l`) turn on
markdown-live-preview-mode to view the exported output side-by-side
with the source Markdown. By default the preview is done in Emacs eww
mode.

There are also packages to preview the saved buffer like
[Markdown preview mode
](https://github.com/ancane/markdown-preview-mode) in melpa.

Some browser extensions allow to copy links as markdown or/and
to capture markdown from a displayed page in the browser:

-   [chitsaou/copy-as-markdown](https://github.com/chitsaou/copy-as-markdown)
    (MIT License)

    and copy link as markdown. The markdown style is configurable
    and include {{< iref "#gfm" "GFM" >}}. A shortcut key
    can be assigned (default `Ctrl + Shift + E` but as it is yet used I prefer
    `Alt + Shift + W`).
-   [Markdown Here](https://markdown-here.com/)  (MIT License)
    is a browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Thunderbird to help you to
    write email, supports them. It provides an easy way of adding tables to your email
    -- a task that would otherwise require copy-pasting from another application.

# Markdown Syntax
The original [Markdown syntax
](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
is summarized in the
[dingus - Markdown on-line converter
](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus),

As the syntax of markdown was only given by informal free text
description, there are many ambiguities that are solved in a different
way by each parser, and numerous extensions.

There are many extensions to markdown such as tables, footnotes,
definition lists,  Markdown inside HTML blocks, source code
higlighting.
Most extensions are bound to one parser and their syntax is given by
the parser manual. See below for each parser. The
{{< iref "#pandoc" "Pandoc" >}} extensions are widely used,
but many are specific to Pandoc.

At least three extensions are quite widespread and many parsers try to
implement them

-   The Older one is
    {{< iref "#php" "php markdown extra" >}}
    that add: Inline HTML, Markdown Inside HTML Blocks,
    Special Attributes, Fenced Code Blocks with <code>~~~</code>,
    Tables, Definition Lists,
    Footnotes, Output, Abbreviations, Emphasis, Backslash Escapes.<br />
    {{< iref "#python" "Python-markdown" >}}group the
    same features in
    {{< iref "#python" "python-markdown-extra" >}};
    and add a rich set of custom extensions.
    <br />
    The other extensions use to build up on markdown extra and extend
    it.
-   [Stack Overflow MarkDown](http://stackoverflow.com/editing-help)
    is a very standard MarkDown with some additions whose main is
    [Syntax highlighting for code
    ](http://stackoverflow.com/editing-help#syntax-highlighting)
    that uses [Google prettify
    ](http://google-code-prettify.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/README.html)
-   <a name="gfm"></a>[Github Flavored Markdown - GFM](https://github.github.com/gfm/)
    is a very popular extension. The main difference is that in Standard
    Markdown newline are ignored and in GFM they are significative.
    GFM disable also disable italicize parts of words, allow
    strikethrough, fenced code block with <code>&#96;&#96;&#96;</code>
    syntax higlighting with <code>&#96;&#96;&#96;python</code> like headers.

    It also add a definition list and a
    [table extension](https://github.github.com/gfm/#tables-extension-),
    task lists, and few GitHub specific shortcuts.

## CommonMark {#commonmark}
[CommonMark](http://commonmark.org/) is a formal specification of
(a flavor of) MarkDown language by John Mac Farlane.

John Mac Farlane previously produced many markdown parsers like
{{< iref "#pandoc" "pandoc" >}} or {{< iref "#peg" "peg-markdown" >}}.

The [specification](http://spec.commonmark.org/) has its [source
on GitHub](http://spec.commonmark.org/). There is also a
[reference card](http://commonmark.org/help/) and an
[interactive tutorial)(http://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/).

You can test and convert on line your CommonMark document on the
[Dingus interactive translator](http://spec.commonmark.org/dingus/)
powered by _commonmark.js_.

John Mac Farlane also provide two implementations,
[cmark](https://github.com/jgm/cmark) written in C, and
[commonmark.js](https://github.com/jgm/commonmark.js)
in javascript.

[CommonMark-py](https://github.com/rtfd/CommonMark-py)
is a pure Python port of jgm's _commonmark.js_,

[recommonmark](http://recommonmark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) A
docutils-compatibility bridge to CommonMark which allows you to write
CommonMark inside of Docutils & Sphinx projects. recommonmark is
written in python, it uses CommonMark-py, [recommonmark source
](http://spec.commonmark.org/) is on GitHub.

Using recommonmark you can [use Markdown in Sphinx
](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/latest/markdown.html)

## Toc in markdown {#markdown_toc}

Automatic Table of content are not part of
[Common Mark Specification](https://spec.commonmark.org/current/)
nor [GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

But many formatters can generate one
In {{< iref "#kramdown" "Kramdown" >}} with
[can generate a toc](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/converter/html.html#toc)
with the `{:toc}` construct.

{{< iref "#redcarpet" "Redcarpet" >}} README explain that *Redcarpet::Render::HTML_TOC*
generate a table of content.

In {{< iref "#markdown-python" "Python Markdown" >}}
you generate toc with
[Table of Contents extension
](https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/toc.html)
which is enabled by including:

    [TOC]

{{< iref "#gitdown" "GitDown" >}} allow toc generation by including
`{"gitdown": "contents"}`

{{< iref "#pandoc" "Pandoc" >}} used with `--toc` or `--table-of-contents` generate a
table of content, you can control its depth with `--toc-depth`.

[Python-Markdown](https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/) (BSD+GPL)
is a python converter is, it allows many [extensions
](https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions).

See also the {{< iref "markdown_cheatsheet" "Mardown CheatSheet" >}} for python-markdown.


There is a [Python-Markdown version 2 or markdown2
](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2)
also [in PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/markdown2).

-   [Python-Markdown Extra
    ](https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/extra.html)
    or for markdown2: <a name="python-markdown-extra"></a>
    [Python Markdown2 Extra
    ](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/wiki/Extras)
    regroup a set of extensions that imitate and extend
    {{< iref "#php" "php-markdown extra" >}}
    by adding :

    -   [abbreviations
        ](https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/abbreviations.html),
    -   [attribute lists
        ](https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions//attr_list.html)
        to define attributes on the various HTML elements in
        markdown’s output. It extend the
        [PHP Markdown Extra extension special attributes
        ](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/#spe-attr),
        also availabe in pandoc for headers, links and fenced code.

        The python-markdown syntax extend the PHP Markdown Extra.
        While an id is written `{#id}` in PHP-Markdown, and also
        undestood as such in pandoc and python-markdown, you can
        write it `{: #id}` in Python-Markdown.
        You can also define other attibutes like
        `{: lang='french' .someclass}` You can define an id for the
        present paragraph by putting as last line `{: #attribute-list
        }`.
        {: #attribute-list }

        Note that the extension [Table of Content
        ](https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/toc.html) and
        the now obsolete
        [headerId
        ](https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/header_id.html)
        automatically generates id attributes for the header elements
        _(except those for which you define a specific header attribute)_.
        This is enabled by default;

        To illustrate this extension I put here a
        `{{< iref "#attribute" "reference to attribute list" >}}`
        {{< iref "#attribute" "reference to attribute list" >}}.

    -   [definition lists
        ](https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/attr_list.html)
        like

            definition list
            :   a type of list were the header is a work, and
                the body is the definition.

    -   [fenced code blocks
        ](https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/fenced_code_blocks.html)
        or [fenced code blocks for markdown2
        ](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/wiki/fenced-code-blocks)
        That can delimit code blocks either with the PHP-Markdown
        syntax `~~~` or the GitHub GFM syntax <code>```</code>.  In
        addition to PHP Extra’s syntax, you can define the
        language of the code block and lines to emphasize for use
        by syntax highlighters like this:

            ```python
            if True:
                print "hi"
            ```

    -   [footnotes
        ](https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/footnotes.html)
        or [footnotes for markdown2
        ](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/wiki/footnotes),
        example:

            Footnotes[^1] have a label[^@#$%] and the footnote's content.

            [^1]: This is a footnote content.
            [^@#$%]: A footnote on the label: "@#$%".

    -   [tables](https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/tables.html)
        or
        [tables for markdown2
        ](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/wiki/tables)
        or [wiki-table for markdown2
        ](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/wiki/wiki-tables)
        and python-markdown third party extension
        [Markdown GridTables
        ](https://github.com/smartboyathome/Markdown-GridTables/)
        that add grid tables as seen in ReSt.
    -   [smart_strong ](https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/smart_strong.html)
        adds smarter handling of double underscores within words.
        the default option _smart-emphasis_ do it for simple underscore.

        python-markdown2 does not have the _smart-strong_ nor the
        _smart-emphasis_ extension instead it provides
        [code-friendly
        ](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/wiki/code-friendly)
        that disable all use of emphasis and strong with a simple or
        double underscore.

-   The other extensions to python-markdown are
    [listed in the doc
    ](http://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/index.html), the
    following ones are enabled by default:

    -   The [CodeHilite extension](https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/code_hilite.html)
        adds code/syntax highlighting to standard Python-Markdown code blocks using
        {{< iref "source_code#pygments" "Pygments" >}}
        It can be used with fenced blocks, or by using
        `:::<language>`
        as the first line of indented code blocks.

        The list of languages is in
        [Pygments language list](http://pygments.org/languages/) and
        [Pygments lexers](http://pygments.org/docs/lexers/).

    -   [headerId
        ](https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/header_id.html)
        automatically generates id attributes for the header
        elements.
    -   [Meta-Data
        ](https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/meta_data.html)
        adds a syntax for defining meta-data about a document.
    -   [Sane Lists
        ](https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/sane_lists.html)
        allow the mixing of list types. In other words, an ordered
        list will not continue when an unordered list item is
        encountered and vice versa.
    -   [Table of Content
        ](https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/toc.html)
        generates a Table of Contents from a Markdown document
        when encountering a `[TOC]` markup.
    -   [WikiLinks
