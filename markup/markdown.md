# Markdown references


-   [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (BSD style license)
    is a text-to-HTML conversion tool originally
    written in perl, but that has also implementations in C, python, php,
    haskell, lua. Markdown

    It can be used in many CMS, blogg software, and Wiki _often through plugins_.

    It is widely used in Django powered applications _using the python implementation_.

    It is the most usual syntax for {{< iref  "static_sites" "Static site generators" >}}

# Markdown Editing
[Emacs Markdown Mode](http://jblevins.org/projects/markdown-mode/) by Jason Blevins is
the standard major mode for editing Markdown formatted text with Emacs.

Markdown Mode can export the buffer to html and preview it (key `C-c C-c v`).

Live Export (`C-c C-c l`) turn on markdown-live-preview-mode to view the exported output
side-by-side with the source Markdown. By default the preview is done in Emacs eww mode.

There are also packages to preview the saved buffer like
[Markdown preview mode](https://github.com/ancane/markdown-preview-mode) in melpa.

You can nicely renders all basic CommonMark syntax with highlighted code blocks in your
terminal with [mdcat](https://github.com/lunaryorn/mdcat) (MPL-2.0) by Sebastian Wiesner
_lunaryorn_.

Some browser extensions allow to copy links as markdown or/and
to capture markdown from a displayed page in the browser:

-   [chitsaou/copy-as-markdown](https://github.com/chitsaou/copy-as-markdown)
    (MIT License)
    is a firefox and Chromium extension to  make copying Link, Image and
    Tab(s) as Markdown much easier. _in 2019 Firefox categorize it in "non recommended
    extension"._.
-   [0x6b/copy-selection-as-markdown
    ](https://github.com/0x6b/copy-selection-as-markdown)  (MIT License)
    is a firefox extension to copy selection as markdown, copy title and url as markdown
    and copy link as markdown. The markdown style is configurable
    and include {{< iref "#gfm" "GFM" >}}. A shortcut key
    can be assigned (default `Ctrl + Shift + E` but as it is yet used I prefer
    `Alt + Shift + W`).
-   [Markdown Here](https://markdown-here.com/)  (MIT License)
    is a browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Thunderbird to help you to
    write email, supports them. It provides an easy way of adding tables to your email
    -- a task that would otherwise require copy-pasting from another application.

# Markdown Syntax
Markdown has be conceived by John Gr√ºber, et also wrote a Perl processor for it.

The original [Markdown syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
is summarized in the [dingus - Markdown on-line converter
](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus),
it is now referred as _Basic Markdown_ or _Vanilla Markdown_.

As the syntax of markdown was only given by informal free text description, there are
many ambiguities that are solved in a different way by each parser, and numerous
extensions.

Markdown  got a de facto standard when the {{< iref "#commonmark" "CommonMark" >}}
formal specification was published by John Mac Farlane.

{{< iref "#commonmark" "CommonMark" >}} gives the syntax for italic, emphasis (i.e
bold), and strong emphasis, hard line break (both 2 spaces and backslash),backtick code
span, ATX and Setext heading, link, image, block quote, indented, and fenced code
block, html block.

Many extensions to the basic and commonmark syntax have been defined, the first one that
predate CommonMark is {{< iref "#php-markdown-extra" "PHP Markdown Extra" >}}.

It adds : Inline HTML, Markdown Inside HTML Blocks, Special Attributes, Fenced Code Blocks
with <code>~~~</code>, Tables, Definition Lists, Footnotes, Output, Abbreviations,
Emphasis, Backslash Escapes.

From {{< iref "#php-markdown-extra" "PHP Markdown Extra" >}} extensions only emphasis,
inline html, fenced code block, backslash escape are part of
{{< iref "#commonmark" "CommonMark" >}}.

Many extensions are added by markdown parsers to {{< iref "#commonmark" "CommonMark" >}}
like tables, footnotes, definition lists, Markdown inside HTML blocks, source code
highlighting.

But the syntax of each construction is bound to one parser and only avilable in the
parser manual (at best, or the source code at worse).

{{< iref "#gfm" "GitHub Flavored  Markdown" >}} used first on GitHub, and later on on
many other popular sites is a specification of markdown which extend
{{< iref "#commonmark" "CommonMark" >}} which add a
[table extension](https://github.github.com/gfm/#tables-extension-), strikethrough,
syntax highlighting  of code,  task list.

Many processors which extend  {{< iref "#commonmark" "CommonMark" >}} use the syntax
which was used in {{< iref "#php-markdown-extra" "PHP Markdown Extra" >}}

-   {{< iref "#pandoc_markdown" "Pandoc Markdown" >}}
    include a set of extensions for MarkDown.

    of various markdown formatters.

## CommonMark {#commonmark}
[CommonMark](http://commonmark.org/) is a formal specification of
(a flavor of) MarkDown language by John Mac Farlane.

John Mac Farlane previously produced many markdown parsers like
{{< iref "#pandoc" "pandoc" >}} or {{< iref "#peg" "peg-markdown" >}}.

The [specification](http://spec.commonmark.org/current) has its
[source on GitHub](http://spec.commonmark.org/). There is also a
[reference card](http://commonmark.org/help/) and an
[interactive tutorial)(http://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/).

You can test and convert on line your CommonMark document on the
[Dingus interactive translator](http://spec.commonmark.org/dingus/)
powered by _commonmark.js_.

John Mac Farlane also provide two implementations, [cmark](https://github.com/jgm/cmark)
written in C, and [commonmark.js](https://github.com/jgm/commonmark.js) in javascript.

[CommonMark-py](https://github.com/rtfd/CommonMark-py)
is a pure Python port of jgm's _commonmark.js_,

[recommonmark](http://recommonmark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) A
docutils-compatibility bridge to CommonMark which allows you to write CommonMark inside
of Docutils & Sphinx projects. recommonmark is written in python, it uses CommonMark-py,
[recommonmark source ](http://spec.commonmark.org/) is on GitHub.

Using recommonmark you can
[use Markdown in Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/latest/markdown.html).

## GitHub Flavored Markdown {#gfm}

[Github Flavored Markdown - GFM](https://github.github.com/gfm/)
add to  {{< iref "#commonmark" "CommonMark" >}} few extensions.

One main difference is that newlines which are ignored in Standard
Markdown  are significative in GFM.

GFM disable also disable italicize parts of words, allow
strikethrough, fenced code block with <code>&#96;&#96;&#96;</code>
syntax higlighting with <code>&#96;&#96;&#96;python</code> like headers.

It also add a [table extension](https://github.github.com/gfm/#tables-extension-),
task lists, and few GitHub specific shortcuts.

-   [GitHub Help: Mastering markdown
    ](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
    is an howto for
    [Github Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

-   [GitLab Flavored Markdown (GLFM)](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html)
    is the extension of CommonMark used in Gitlab.
-   [Stack Overflow MarkDown](http://stackoverflow.com/editing-help)
    is a standard MarkDown with some additions including
    [GFM pipe tables](https://github.github.com/gfm/#tables-extension-) and
    [Syntax highlighting for code
    ](http://stackoverflow.com/editing-help#syntax-highlighting)
    that uses [Google prettify
    ](http://google-code-prettify.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/README.html)

## MarkDown extensions

### Definition list

Definition list are not part of {{< iref "#commonmark" "Commonmark" >}} nor
{{< iref "#gfm" "Github Flavored Markdown" >}} but this is a common extension
which comes from {{< iref "#php-markdown-extra" "PHP Markdown Extra" >}}
with the syntax [PHP_Markdown_Extra definition list
](http://www.michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/extra/#def-list)

```markdown
definition list
:   a type of list were the header is a work, and
the body is the definition.
```

If you need to use only  {{< iref "#commonmark" "Commonmark" >}} or
{{< iref "#gfm" "Github Flavored Markdown" >}} you can include definition list as html
code with `<dl>`, `<dd>`, `<dt>` tags.

### Fenced code block
The syntax is [PHP Markdown Extra fenced code block
](http://www.michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/extra/#fenced-code-blocks) and was also
implemented in [Python Markdown fenced code blocks
](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/fenced_code_blocks/)
or [fenced code blocks for python markdown2
](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/wiki/fenced-code-blocks).

Fenced code block are not truly _an extension_, they were not present in basic Markdown
but they are [part of CommonMark](https://spec.commonmark.org/curent/#fenced-code-blocks).


They are also
[part of GFM specification*](https://github.github.com/gfm/#fenced-code-blocks)
and described also in [Creating and highlighting code blocks - GitHub Docs
](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks).

You can delimit code blocks either with
`~~~` or  <code>```</code>, instead of the four space indentation of code blocks in
basic Markdown.

Many processors allow highlighting of the code block by following the backticks or tildes
with the code language like:

```python
if True:
    print("hi")
```

The available languages and the library used to highlight the code depends on the
Markdown processor used.

GFM uses [linguist](https://github.com/github/linguist) with a huge
[list of grammar](https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/vendor/README.md)
and
[corresponding languages](https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/lib/linguist/languages.yml).

Many markdown processors can render code highlight, including
{{< iref "#pandoc" "pandoc" >}},
{{< iref "#python-markdown" "Python MarkDown and python Markdown2" >}},
{{< iref "#goldmark" "goldmark" >}}, {{< iref "#blackfriday" "BlackFriday" >}},
{{< iref "#lowdown" "Lowdown" >}}, {{< iref "#cdiscount" "cdiscount" >}}
Maruku, {{< iref "#kramdown" "Kramdown" >}},
{{< iref "#markdown-it" "Markdown-It through a plugin" >}},
{{< iref "#multimarkdown" "MultiMarkdown" >}}.

### Toc  {#markdown_toc}

Automatic Table of content are not part of
[Common Mark Specification](https://spec.commonmark.org/current/)
nor [GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

But many formatters can generate one.

In {{< iref "#kramdown" "Kramdown" >}} can
[generate a toc](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/converter/html.html#toc)
with the `{:toc}` construct.

{{< iref "#redcarpet" "Redcarpet" >}} README explain that *Redcarpet::Render::HTML_TOC*
generate a table of content.

In {{< iref "#markdown-python" "Python Markdown" >}}
you generate toc with
[Table of Contents extension](https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/toc.html)
which is enabled by including:

```
[TOC]
```

{{< iref "#gitdown" "GitDown" >}} allow toc generation by including
`{"gitdown": "contents"}`

{{< iref "#pandoc" "Pandoc" >}} used with `--toc` or `--table-of-contents` generate a
table of content, you can control its depth with `--toc-depth`.

A toc can also be generated by {{< iref "#remarkable" "remarkable" >}},
{{< iref "#remark" "remark" >}}

## Markdown formatters and linters

For Styling Markdown you can find some guides, which propose diverse conventions, often
incompatible. Some want ATX headers other Setext headers, some want a 2 space
indentation other 4 spaces, some accept indented code blocks, other only fenced code
block; some want a big line without soft break, others impose a 8O columns limit ....

    by John MacFarlane is a {{< iref "#Commonmark" "CommonMark" >}} markdown
    implementation in javascript.  Instead of converting Markdown directly to HTML, as
    most converters do, commonmark.js parses Markdown to an AST (abstract syntax tree),

There is a [Python-Markdown version 2 or markdown2

also [in PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/markdown2).

-   <a name="python-markdown-extra"></a>[Python-Markdown Extra
    ](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/extra/)
    or for markdown2:
    [Python Markdown2 Extra
    ](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/wiki/Extras)
    regroup a set of extensions that imitate and extend
    {{< iref "#php" "php-markdown extra" >}}
    by adding :

    -   [abbreviations](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/abbreviations/),
    -   [attribute lists](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/attr_list/)
        to define attributes on the various HTML elements in
        markdown‚Äôs output. It extend the
        [PHP Markdown Extra extension special attributes
        ](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/#spe-attr),
        also availabe in pandoc for headers, links and fenced code.

        The python-markdown syntax extend the PHP Markdown Extra.
        While an id is written `{#id}` in PHP-Markdown, and also
        undestood as such in pandoc and python-markdown, you can
        write it `{: #id}` in Python-Markdown.
        You can also define other attibutes like
        `{: lang='french' .someclass}` You can define an id for the
        present paragraph by putting as last line `{: #attribute-list
        }`.
        {: #attribute-list }

        Note that the extension [Table of Content
        ](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/toc/)
        automatically generates id attributes for the header elements
        _(except those for which you define a specific header attribute)_.
        This is enabled by default;

        To illustrate this extension I put here a
        `{{< iref "#attribute" "reference to attribute list" >}}`
        {{< iref "#attribute" "reference to attribute list" >}}.

    -   [definition lists

        or alternatively [GitHub Flavored Markdown
        ](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks).

        They can delimit code blocks either with the PHP-Markdown
        syntax `~~~` or the GitHub GFM syntax <code>```</code>.

    -   [footnotes](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/footnotes/)
        or [footnotes for markdown2
        ](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/wiki/footnotes).

        The syntax is the same than  [PHP Markdown Extra
        ](http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/extra/#footnotes)

        Example:

        ```markdown
        Footnotes[^1] have a label[^@#$%] and the footnote's content.

        [^1]: This is a footnote content.
        [^@#$%]: A footnote on the label: "@#$%".
        ```

    -   [tables](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/tables/)
        or
        [tables for markdown2
        ](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/wiki/tables)
        have the same syntax than  [PHP Markdown Extra
        ](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/#table).

        -   [wiki-table for markdown2
            ](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/wiki/wiki-tables)
            support Google Code wiki-style tables.

    -   The [PHP Markdown Extra Emphasis
        ](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/#em)
        which treat internal underscore literally is the default in Python Markdown.

        python-markdown2 add an extension
        [code-friendly](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/wiki/code-friendly)
        that disable all use of emphasis and strong with a simple or double underscore.

-   The other official extensions to python-markdown are
    [listed in the doc](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/), the
    following ones are enabled by default:
