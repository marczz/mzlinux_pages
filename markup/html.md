# Favicons
Shortcut icons (favicon.ico files) in  browsers are a
feature that you can use to display your own logo in bookmarks menus.

They are 16x16 pixel graphic.Favicon.ico file is generally saved on the
root of your website, but can also be given by

    <head>
      <link rel="shortcut icon" href="http://www.yourdomain.com/iconname.ico"/>
    </head>

IE only accept he windoze proprietary ico format that you can generates
from open source formats with utilities like
[pngtoico](http://www.winterdrache.de/freeware/png2ico/), or with the
Gimp. Except for the most tyrannic browser you can use other formats
like png, gif, jpeg, xbm so you will put in your page:

    <head>
      <link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="/favicon.png" />
    </head>

If you put both in your page you will get an icon for IE (please choose
a frightening one) and one for true browsers.

## Multicolumn
[CSS Multi-column Layout Module](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/)
allow to output in multiple columns. Most of them work either in
webkit or mozilla _firefox_ by prepending either `-moz-` or
`-webkit-` to the css option. You can apply it to any container
including the full `body`.

The rendering of the different options are tested in
[[http://quirksmode.org/css/columns/][Quirksmode - CSS columns]], the
different working options are `column-count`, `column-gap`,
`column-rule`, `column-width`. The options for break, fill, span don't
yet work except opera that has the best support.

These options also [work on mobile
](http://quirksmode.org/css/columns/mobile.html).
