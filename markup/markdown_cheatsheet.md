<a id="H_header"></a>
## Header

```markdown
# H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6

Alternatively, for H1 and H2, an underline-ish style:

Alt-H1
======

Alt-H2
------
```
<div class="example">

# H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6


Alternatively, for H1 and H2, an underline-ish style:

</div>

<a id="H_TOC_insert"></a>
## Inserting a Table of content

The previous Table of Content is manual we just use:

```markdown
-   [Headers](#H_headers "Internal Reference")
-   [TOC Insert](#H_TOC_insert "Internal Reference")
-   [Emphasis](#H_emphasis "Internal Reference")
...
...
```

And the link reference is set with:
~~~markdown
<a id="H_headers"></a>
## Headers
...
<a id="H_TOC_insert"></a>
## Inserting a Table of contents
...
<a name="H_emphasis"></a>
## Emphasis
~~~

Automatic Table of content are not part of [Common Mark Specification][Common Mark]
nor [GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec][GFM].
but can be generated by many formatters and markdown preprocessors. See the section
{{< iref "markdown#mardown_toc" "Markdown TOC" >}} for a list.

This page is generated by [Hugo][] which call [GoldMark][], they allow an automatic
table of content, which is generated using automatic section link references. You can
see it on the hight-left part of the page.


<a name="H_emphasis"></a>
## Emphasis

```markdown
Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

~~Strikethrough~~ is not in [Common Mark][], nor [Python Markdown][] but
[Pandoc][] with the extension _strikeout_, [GFM][] and all [GFM][] compatible procesors
use two tildes for ~~strikethrough~~.
```

</div>

<a name="H_break"></a>
## Line Break {#break}

A new paragraph is started by to consecutive new-lines.

To force a line return in the same paragraph, you will need to use two
trailing spaces in the [original Markdown specification][JG Markdown]. But a trailing
space is hardly visible _except if your editor highlight them_, is easily discarded
by editors, and are a nuisance in _Git_ or other code versionning.

[Common Mark][] add the use of a trailing backslash to generate hard line
breaks, this convention is also part of [GFM][] and followed by many Markdown processors.
<!-- like [Pandoc][] with the extension *escaped_line_breaks*. -->

```markdown
These two lines form a single paragraph, which will fill the available space,
the single newlines in the source have no influence on the formatted text.

This a separate paragraph as it is separated from the previous by two newlines.\
This line is a separate line in the same paragraph, due to to the trailing backslash,<br>
or by using an html `<br>`.
```

<div class="example">

</div>

If your processor accept raw html you can also use `<br>`.

Some other processors give additional line break syntax. With
[python markdown nl2b](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/nl2br/) or the
[Pandoc][] extension *hard_line_breaks* an ordinary newline break paragraphs.



<a name="H_list"></a>
## List

### Ordered List

```markdown
1.  First ordered list item
2.  Another item
    *   Unordered sub-list.
1.  Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
    1.  Ordered sub-list
4.  And another item.

    You can have properly indented paragraphs within list
    items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces.
    [Python Markdown][] require to indent 4 spaces.

    This is a new paragraph.\
    This last line is [separate, but within the same paragraph](#break).
```

<div class="example">

</div>

<a id="breaking_lists"></a>If two lists are subsequent the second is considered as the
continuation of the first, except if you change the list marker like swithing from `-`
to `*` or `1.` to `1)`. To break a list in two lists without changing marker can use a
`<br/>` `<!--` _comment_ `-->` or `&nbsp;`

### Unordered Lists
```markdown
*   Unordered list can use asterisks
    *    sublist
*   Second item in the list.
-   Or first item with minus,
-   second with minus.
+   Or pluses
```
<div class="example">

*  Unordered list can use asterisks
    *    sublist
*   Second item in the list.
-   Or first item with minus,
-   second with minus.
+   Or pluses

</div>

_Note how applies the [breaking list rules](#breaking_lists), in the previous example._

### Definition Lists
The definitions lists are not part of [Common Mark](http://spec.commonmark.org/), nor
[GFM](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

But we find
[Definition Lists extension
](https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/definition_lists.html)
in the standard [Python Markdown][] library,
[PHP markdown extra
](http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/extra/#def-list),
[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#definition-lists), [MultiMarkDown][],
[Goldmark][], _Discount_, _Markdown-it_, etc.

```markdown
Apple
:   Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus _Malus_ in
    the family _Rosaceae_.

 <a name="orange"></a>Orange
:   The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus _Citrus_.

<a id="distraction"></a>Distraction
:   The fruit of lack of concentration.
```

<div id="example">

Apple
:   Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus _Malus_ in
    the family _Rosaceae_.

 <a name="orange"></a>Orange
:   The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus _Citrus_.

<a id="distraction"></a>Distraction
:   The fruit of lack of concentration.

</id>

As you see above we can add a {{< iref "#orange" "name" >}} or
{{< iref "#distraction" "id" >}} to have references to list items.

```markdown
Wen a _Markdown_ syntax for definition list is unvalailable we use [raw HTML
](#raw_html)

<dl>
<dt>Apple</dt>
   <dd>Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus _Malus_ in
    the family _Rosaceae_.</dd>

<dt name="orange"></a>Orange</dt>
    <dd>The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus _Citrus_.</dd>

<dt id="distraction">Distraction</dt>
    <dd>The fruit of lack of concentration.</dd>
</dl>
```

<div id="example">

Wen a _Markdown_ syntax for definition list is unvalailable we use [raw HTML
](#raw_html)

<dl>
<dt>Apple</dt>
   <dd>Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus _Malus_ in
    the family _Rosaceae_.</dd>

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself]
<dt name="orange"></a>Orange</dt>
    <dd>The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus _Citrus_.</dd>

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.
    <dd>The fruit of lack of concentration.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org

[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com
```
</div>

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)
<a id="H_link"></a>
## Link

### Writing link reference.

There are two ways to create a link _inline_ or _reference-style_. With _reference-style_
links you put anywhere in the same file _usually at end of section or page_ the
reference text.

```markdown
-   [inline-style link](https://www.fsf.org/)
-   [inline-style link with title](https://www.gnu.org/ "GNU's Homepage")
-   [reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]
-   [link to a  relative path](../../network/social_networks/)
-   [number reference-style link][1]
-   Use the [link text itself as reference]

<!-- the references follow -->

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
[1]: http://slashdot.org  "The title is Slashdot!"
[link text itself as reference]: https://www.laquadrature.net/en/personnal-data/
```
<div class="example">

-   [inline-style link](https://www.fsf.org/)
-   [inline-style link with title](https://www.gnu.org/ "GNU's Homepage")
-   [reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]
-   [link to a  relative path](../../network/social_networks/)
-   [number reference-style link][1]
-   Use the [link text itself as reference]

<!-- the references follow -->

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
[1]: http://slashdot.org  "The title is Slashdot!"
[link text itself as reference]: https://www.laquadrature.net/en/personnal-data/

</div>

### Defining the link target.

A link target i.e *id* or *name* can be defined  by giving the
html code with any formatter that allow raw HTML (most of them):

```markdown
<a name="link-target"></a> Target Text\
...\
[Reference to the link target in the present page"](#link-target)
```
<div class="example">

<a name="link-target"></a> Target Text\
...\
[Reference to the link target in the present page"](#link-target)

</div>

Some formatter allow the use of automatic link targets for sections.
You can then use the title of sections _in lowercase, accent removed,  spaces
replaced by minus, and omitting special characters_.

```markdown
[link to the "Writing links references" Subsection](#writing-links-references)
```

## Markdown parsers and attributes {#attributes}

The basis of defining a link target is in the {{< iref "#list" "previous section" >}}.

The general syntax for attributes is
```text
{: key1=val key2="long val" #myid .class1 .class2}
```

We have key-value pairs, `#myid` is equivlallent to `id=myid`,
`.class1` to `class=class1`,

An attribute list for a header is put on the line of the header.
for pandoc or php-markdown don't use `{: }` but `{ }`.


For a span level element you put it after the element. So:
```text
We are here inside the **second**{: #id1} paragraph.
{: #otherid}
```

generate:

```html
<p id="otherid">We are here inside the <strong id="id1">second</strong> paragraph.</p>
```

This work at least in python-markdown, maruku, and [kramdown
](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html).

For pandoc you should use *native spans*.
```text
```markdown
<span id=otherid>We are here inside the <span id=id1>**second**</span>
paragraph</span>
```


We take  a small example to show how attributes are handled
in diverse ways by the different parsers.

```markdown
Simple test
===========

## first section
We refer here to the {{< iref "#deux" "paragraph" >}} inside this
{{< iref "#sub_two" "subsection" >}}. Yes {{< iref "#otherid" "this one" >}}.

## second section
First an useless paragraph.
{: #python-markdown_style_ref class="red"}

### subparagraph of third paragraph {#sub_two class="blue"}
<div id="deux">
We are here inside the **second** paragraph.
<a id="otherid"></a>
</div>
```

With python markdown with _Extra_ extensions we get
```html
<h1 id="simple-test">Simple test</h1>
<h2 id="first-section">first section</h2>
<p>We refer here to the <a href="#deux">paragraph</a> inside this <a href="#sub_two">subsection</a>. Yes <a href="#otherid">this one</a>.</p>
<h2 id="second-section">second section</h2>
<p>First an useless paragraph. {: #python-markdown_style_ref class=&quot;red&quot;}</p>
<h3 id="sub_two" class="blue">subparagraph of third paragraph</h3>
<div id="deux">
<p>We are here inside the <strong>second</strong> paragraph. <a id="otherid"></a></p>
</div>
```

With pandoc
```html
<h1 id="simple-test">Simple test</h1>
<h2 id="first-section">first section</h2>
<p>We refer here to the <a href="#deux">paragraph</a> inside this <a href="#sub_two">subsection</a>. Yes <a href="#otherid">this one</a>.</p>
<h2 id="second-section">second section</h2>
<p>First an useless paragraph. {: #python-markdown_style_ref class=&quot;red&quot;}</p>
<h3 id="sub_two" class="blue">subparagraph of third paragraph</h3>
<div id="deux">
<p>We are here inside the <strong>second</strong> paragraph. <a id="otherid"></a></p>
```

The `{: }` is not understood.

With pandoc when disabling *raw_html*:
```html
<h1 id="simple-test">Simple test</h1>
<h2 id="first-section">first section</h2>
<p>We refer here to the <a href="#deux">paragraph</a> inside this <a href="#sub_two">subsection</a>. Yes <a href="#otherid">this one</a>.</p>
<h2 id="second-section">second section</h2>
<p>First an useless paragraph. {: #python-markdown_style_ref class=&quot;red&quot;}</p>
<h3 id="sub_two" class="blue">subparagraph of third paragraph</h3>
<div id="deux">
<p>We are here inside the <strong>second</strong> paragraph. &lt;a id=&quot;otherid&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p>
</div>
```
The only attributes rendered are those in `<div>` and the `{ }`
syntax. It could seem strange that  `<div>` is handled even when
*raw_html* is disabled, but these `<div>` are not raw html for pandoc
but *native div*, in the same way there are *native span*.

This is quite important when converting to an other text format,
because if we use pandoc to convert this text to _asciidoc_ we get:

```markdown
Simple test
-----------

[[first-section]]
first section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We refer here to the link:#deux[paragraph] inside this
link:#sub_two[subsection]. Yes link:#otherid[this one].

[[second-section]]
second section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First an useless paragraph. \{: #python-markdown_style_ref class="red"}

[[sub_two]]
subparagraph of third paragraph
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[[deux]]
We are here inside the *second* paragraph.
```

The references in `<div>`, `<span>`, `{ }` are translated, the html
is not translated and appear as raw html.

<a name="H_code"></a>
## Code and Syntax Highlighting {#code}

```markdown
Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.
```

Blocks of code are indented with four spaces.
In code blocks markup is uninterpreted.

    Simple Code block with
    uninterpreted _markup_


With the [GFM fenced code block](https://github.github.com/gfm/#fenced-code-blocks)
code blocks can be fenced by lines with three
back-ticks <code>```</code>, or  three tilda <code>~~~</code>.

The fenced code blocks are also supported by [Markdown Extras
](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/#fenced-code-blocks)
_only with tilda_,
[Python Markdown](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/fenced_code_blocks/),

In _Python Markdown_ Fenced Code Blocks are only supported at the document root level.
Therefore, they cannot be nested inside lists or blockquotes.


Code blocks are part of the Markdown spec either the older [John Gruber Markdown][],
[Common Mark][] or [GFM][], but syntax highlighting is not part of these specification
and rely on libraries called by renderers.

Many renderers -- like Github's GFM, _Stack Overflow_,
_Python-Markdown_, _[Pandoc][]_, ...  -- support syntax
highlighting.

Which languages are supported and how those language names should be written will vary
from renderer to renderer.

List of libraries used by some few markdown formatters:

-   The reference [GFM][] parser [cmark-gfm]() don't provide any syntax highlighting.
    _but somme wrappers can also delegate highlighting to an other library_.
-   GitHub own [GFM][] uses [Linguist](https://github.com/github/linguist) to detect languages,
    it uses a
    [list of grammar libraries](https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/vendor/README.md)
    The list of supported languages is in the
    [language.yml](https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/lib/linguist/languages.yml)
    file.
-   [GitLab GFM][] and [KramDown][] use [Rouge](http://rouge.jneen.net/) to highlight code with this
    [list of supported languages
    ](https://github.com/rouge-ruby/rouge/wiki/List-of-supported-languages-and-lexers).
-   Most Node.js parsers including [Markdown Here][], [Markdown-it][], [Marked][];
    use [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) with this
    [list of language and higlighting demo](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js).
-   *Python Markdown* uses [Pygments](http://pygments.org) supports highlighting for
    dozens of language and markup; to see the complete list, see the
    [Pygments language list](http://pygments.org/languages/) and
    [Pygments lexers](http://pygments.org/docs/lexers/).
-   [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#syntax-highlighting) uses the library
    [skylighting](https://github.com/jgm/skylighting/)
    with accept these
    [languages](https://github.com/jgm/skylighting/tree/master/skylighting-core/xml).
-   [Hugo][] use [GoldMark][] as formatter which does not bind itself to a syntax
    highlighter, but add syntax highlighting with
    [Chroma](https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma) which is mostly compatible with
    [Pygment][] and support these
    [languages](https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma#supported-languages).

The name of the used lexer is put at the end of the _fence
line_.

``` markdown
~~~ javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
~~~

~~~ C
for (i=1; i<10; i++){
  print("a string in a loop")
}
~~~

~~~ python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print (s)
~~~

~~~ bash
#!/bin/bash
line="Bash syntax highlighting"
echo ${line}
~~~

~~~ bash-session
# echo "no more a comment"
# line="sh script syntax highlighting"
# echo "bash-session don't yet work with Chroma"
# echo ${line}
~~~


~~~ text

A bold html <b>tag</b> or a **Mardown one**,
is uninterpreted.
~~~

~~~ json
{
  "Name": "Σωκρᾰ́της"
  "EnglishName": "Socrates"
  "Birth Date": "470 BC"
}
~~~
```

<div class="example">

~~~ javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
~~~

~~~ C
for (i=1; i<10; i++){
  print("a string in a loop")
}

  "Birth Date": "470 BC"
}
~~~

</div>

Some parser _and the associated highlighter_ may also infer the language from the
content of the block.

[Python Markdown][] allow also to define a highlight language not only for fenced code
blocks but also for an indented code block in a header introduced by `:::`, or inferred
from the content of the block. Examples are given below.

Some parsers like [Python Markdown][] [Kramdown][] or [Pandoc]() can use an
[Attribute List](#attributes "local reference").

[Hugo][] uses [Highlight Shortcode
](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/)
wich can take some options. Example:

~~~ text
``` yaml {linenos=table,hl_lines=[2]}
Philosopher:
  "Name": "Σωκρᾰ́της"
  "EnglishName": "Socrates"
  "Birth Date": "470 BC"
```
~~~

<div class="example">

``` yaml {linenos=table,hl_lines=[2]}
Philosopher:
  "Name": "Σωκρᾰ́της"
  "EnglishName": "Socrates"
  "Birth Date": "470 BC"
```

</div>

<a name="H_table"></a>
## Table

Tables aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but are one of
[GFM table](https://github.github.com/gfm/#tables-extension-).

{{< iref "markdown#php-markdown-extra" "PHP Markdown Extra" >}}
has a [table extension](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/#table) similar
to the GFM one.

This syntax is used in numerous formatters like:

-   {{< iref "markdown#hoedown" "Hoedown" >}},
    {{< iref "markdown#lowdown" "lowdown" >}} _(C)_,
-   {{< iref "markdown#redcarpet" "Redcarpet" >}},
    {{< iref "markdown#kramdown" "#kramdown" >}}   _(Ruby)_ ,
-   {{< iref "markdown#blackfriday" "BlackFriday" >}},
    {{< iref "markdown#goldmark" "GoldMark" >}} _(GO)_,
-   {{< iref "markdown#gfms" "gfms" >}},
    {{< iref "markdown#gitdown" "Gitdown" >}},
    {{< iref "markdown#node_gfm" "node gfm" >}},
    {{< iref "markdown#marked" "Marked" >}},
    {{< iref "markdown#remarkable" "Remarkable" >}}
    _(Node.js)_

_and many others._

[Markdown Here](https://markdown-here.com/), a browser extension to
help you to write email, supports them. It provides an easy way of adding
tables to your email -- a task that would otherwise require
copy-pasting from another application.

In {{< iref "markdown#pandoc" "Pandoc" >}} there are many
[table extensions](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#tables)
including these GFM tables under the extension name `pipe_table`.



```text
Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the raw
Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty

## Inline HTML {#html}

You can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it'll mostly work pretty well.

## Horizontal Rule {#hr}



***

Asterisks

___

Underscores
```






You can use Three or more hyphens or asterisks or underscore.

```markdown
Three or more...

---

Hyphens  or asterisks or underscore.
```

<div class="example">
Three or more...

---

Hyphens or asterisks or underscore.
</div>

## Youtube videos {#videos}

They can't be added directly but you can add an image with a link to
the video like this:

```text
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE
" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg"
alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="240" height="180" border="10" /></a>
```

Or, in pure Markdown, but losing the image sizing and border:

```text
[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE)
```
