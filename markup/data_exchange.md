# CSV

{{< wp "Comma-separated values" >}}  is a delimited text file that uses a comma to
separate values.

The name is used more widely for any delimiter separated values where the delimiter is
any character usually non alpha-numeric.

It is a very common data exchange format used by many spreadsheet and database software.

There is a an attempt to normalize CSV in the
[RFC 4180](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180)
and also a set of documents produced by the  W3Câ€™s CSV on the Web Working Group, that you
find in [GitHub - w3c/csvw](https://github.com/w3c/csvw). It includes recommendations
for generating  {{< wp "Resource Description Framework" "RDF" >}} and JSON from CSV.

For examples of CSV and characters escape in fields look at the
{{< wp "Comma-separated values#Basic_rules" "Wikipedia CSV basic rules" >}}.

    wich aim at he same goals and is only 867 pages in length.

-   {{< wp "OpenDocument" >}} (ODF) is an XML open OASIS standard. It has been
    developped by Sun Microsystems with IBM contributions.
